A NEW VISION FOR  
UK MANUFACTURING

Manufacturing in 2050 will look very different from 
today, and will be virtually unrecognisable from that 
of 30 years ago. Successful firms will be capable 
of rapidly adapting their physical and intellectual 
infrastructures to exploit changes in technology as 
manufacturing becomes faster, more responsive to 
changing global markets and closer to customers.

Successful firms will also harness a wider skills base,  
with highly qualified leaders and managers whose 
expertise combines both commercial and technical 
acumen, typically in science, technology, engineering  
or mathematics. 

Constant adaptability will pervade all aspects of 
manufacturing, from research and development 
to innovation, production processes, supplier and 
customer interdependencies, and lifetime product 
maintenance and repair. Products and processes will 
be sustainable, with built-in reuse, remanufacturing 
and recycling for products reaching the end of their 
useful lives. Closed loop systems will be used to 
eliminate energy and water waste and to recycle 
physical waste. 

These developments will further emphasise the key 
role of physical production in unlocking innovative 
new revenue streams, particularly as firms embrace 
‘servitisation’ and manufacturers make use of the 
increasing pervasiveness of ‘Big Data’ to enhance  
their competitiveness. 

In the public sector, policy frameworks that affect 
the manufacturing sector directly and indirectly will 
need to recognise the extended nature of value 
creation and the new ways it is being developed. 
Public planning cycles should match the timescales 
of firms’ own long term planning requirements. 
And it will be important that flows of highly skilled 
workers, patient capital, and support to promote 
critical mass in small and medium sized enterprises 
are all internationally competitive. 

The implications for UK manufacturing firms and the 
UK Government are substantial. Some businesses are 
already adapting and are world class, but many are 
not positioned to succeed in a future world where 

greater opportunities will be balanced by greater 
competition. The UK needs to radically change its 
approach to providing a constant and consistent 
framework within which all firms aspire to prosper. 

A business-as-usual approach will not deliver that 
outcome. Other economies are already ahead, and 
catching up will require an adaptive capacity that  
the UK has not yet demonstrated. Achieving this  
is essential, as the future competitiveness and health  
of UK manufacturing will affect many other parts  
of the economy through its numerous linkages. 

The key message is that there is no easy or immediate 
route to success, but action needs to start now 
to build on existing support, and to refocus and 
rebalance it for the future. Above all, policy design 
will need to address entire system effects. This 
Report sets out many areas where action is needed 
at both strategic and more detailed levels. However, 
the following should be particular priorities. 

The quality and skills of the workforce will be a 
critical factor in capturing competitive advantage. 
It is essential that UK policy makers focus on the 
supply of skilled workers, including apprenticeship 
schemes, support for researchers, and the supply 
of skilled managers. Firms will need to pay much 
more attention to building multidisciplinary teams 
to develop increasingly complex products, and also 
innovative business models. 

It will also be crucial to address the current image 
associated with manufacturing. Here government 
and industry should work together to further 
promote and market the opportunities for careers 
in manufacturing industries at all levels of education. 

Financial challenges for the sector include a shortage 
of risk capital. This is particularly evident as a funding 
gap between research and early development and the 
funding for proof of concept that is usually required 
before the market steps in. There is also a shortage 
of funding for applied research and development in 
some areas such as the development of advanced 
green energy sources. So although there are excellent 
schemes for public support such as Knowledge 

The future of manufacturing: A new era of opportunity and challenge for the UK

7

Transfer Partnerships, funding of the Technology 
Strategy Board, and public private partnerships such 
as the Energy Technologies Institute, these are much 
smaller than in competitor nations. Addressing this 
mismatch should be a priority. 

Recent years have seen a resurgence in the 
development of industrial policies by governments  
in the UK and overseas. In the UK, industrial policies 
have been developed in 11 sectors, led in most cases 
by groups from the public and private sectors, with 
many of these encompassing manufacturing industries. 
One specific development has been the creation of 
the Catapult Centres. In particular, the High Value 
Manufacturing Catapult provides a strong base on  
which to build substantial further effort. It is 
recommended that its funding is substantially 
increased, and used in part to encourage the 
greater involvement of smaller firms in particular. 

Whilst specific initiatives are essential in areas 
mentioned above, more is needed. Recognition 
that the UK’s national infrastructure suffered from 
fragmented policy making led to the creation of 
Infrastructure UK (IUK). Manufacturing suffers from 
similar challenges and is no less strategic for the future 
strength and resilience of the UK economy. The Lead 
Expert Group of this Foresight Project considers that 
a similar office to the IUK is needed for Manufacturing. 
This would be responsible for helping Government 
to formulate long-term policies that would take into 
account the extended value chain associated with 
manufacturing industries. 

It should be staffed by experts, preferably with 
substantial successful industry experience. They 
would consider all of the issues highlighted in this 
Report, and develop and assist Government with 
piloting new policies. A UK Office for Manufacturing 
would need to work closely with IUK, in view of 
the importance of infrastructure to manufacturing. 
It would also need to work closely with industry, 
particularly to improve skills and increase the ability 
of companies to innovate by working with relevant 
partners. Other countries including the United 
States and Australia have developed relevant 
offices from which the UK can learn. 

In summary, manufacturing is too important to 
leave to its own devices. The Lead Expert Group 
for this project, comprising Academic and Industry 
leaders commend this Report to Government, 
together with its associated analysis and evidence 
underpinning its conclusions.

Preface

It is surely unique in Europe, if not globally, for  
a Government to commission a strategic look at 
the future of manufacturing as far ahead as 2050.

This report – involving some 300 leading  
business people, experts and policy makers from 
25 countries – sets out a vision of manufacturing that 
is very different to what we recognise today. Clearly, 
both industry and Government need to prepare 
for what will be considerable opportunities and 
challenges ahead.

The importance of manufacturing to the UK 
economy, as set out here, is incontrovertible. 
Manufacturing is no longer just about production, 
it is a much wider set of activities that create 
value for the UK and benefits for wider society. 
Manufacturing includes significant innovation. It 
creates jobs that are both highly skilled and well 
paid. It also contributes to the rebalancing of the 
economy, with its strong role on exports and 
import substitutions.

Through the Government’s industrial strategy  
we are already working with business on  
long-range plans to strengthen advanced 
manufacturing sectors such as automobiles, 
aerospace, life sciences and energy supply  
chains. We are developing the UK’s ability  
to commercialise new technology and expand  
our skills base.

There are many UK manufacturing firms that  
are world class. Indeed, manufacturing leads  
other sectors in many areas, including productivity, 
exports and research and development. There  
is no room for complacency, however.

The analysis and advice contained in this report 
will help Government to take its support for 
manufacturing to another level. My officials will  
be working with the project experts to work  
out next steps. I look forward to seeing how their 
conclusions help Government and industry to 
harness the full potential of UK manufacturing.

Summary Report

1. MANUFACTURING 
MATTERS

Manufacturing is essential for long 
term economic growth and economic 
resilience. However, many of its 
characteristics are changing profoundly. 
Physical production processes are 
increasingly at the centre of much 
wider value chains. 

A POWERFUL CONTRIBUTION TO  
THE UK ECONOMY

Manufacturing is and must continue to be an essential 
part of the UK economy. Its benefits include:

 Absolute value: The contribution of 
manufacturing to UK Gross Domestic 
Product (£139 billion in 2012) is still 
significant1 and increasing over the long term2.

 Research and Development (R&D): 
Manufacturing businesses are more likely 
to engage in R&D. 41% of manufacturing 
businesses with ten or more employees 
allocated resources to R&D in 2010 compared 
with an average of 23% of businesses in other 
sectors. Throughout 2000-2011, 72%-79% 
of total UK business R&D expenditure was 
associated with manufacturing3. 

 Innovation: Manufacturers are more likely 
to innovate. In 2010, 26% of manufacturing 
businesses with ten or more employees 
carried out process innovation compared 
with less than 14% for non-manufacturers, 
and 44% undertook product innovation 
(less than 26% for non-manufacturers)4. 

 Productivity: The growth in total factor 
productivityi for manufacturing has been 2.3% 
per year between 1980 and 2009, compared 
with 0.7% per year for the UK as a whole5.

i Total Factor Productivity (TFP) is defined as the increase in output 
that is not due to an increase in the direct inputs used to produce 
goods and services (i.e. labour, physical capital and intermediate inputs). 
Rather it is the more efficient use of these inputs.

 Exports: Manufacturing businesses are more 
likely to engage in exporting. UK exports of 
goods produced by the manufacturing sector 
totalled £256 billion in 2012, accounting for 
around 53% of all UK exports6. In 2010, 60% 
of manufacturing businesses with ten or more 
employees exported products and services 
compared with 26% of non-manufacturers7. 
 Highly skilled jobs: In 2011, remuneration in UK 
manufacturing was 10% higher in comparable 
occupations compared with the average across 
all industries8, reflecting the high levels of skills 
required in modern manufacturing roles. 
 Inter-industry linkages: Manufacturing performance 
affects other sectors through its wide range of 
input-output and other linkages9.
 Economic resilience: Economies with strong, 
export-led manufacturing sectors typically 
recover from recessions faster than those 
without equivalent manufacturing sectors10.

A DIVERSE SECTOR WITH A CONTEXT 
OF HISTORICAL SHIFTS 

The UK manufacturing sector is diverse, with 
activities ranging from aerospace, pharmaceuticals, 
chemicals and automotives to food and drink.  
It is characterised by a wide range of sizes of firm, 
with a disproportionate share of activity accounted 
for by a small number of large, often foreign owned 
multinational companies. Although most firms  
are small, with 87% of firms employing less than  
20 employees in 2009, large firms generate most  
of the value added and dominate R&D expenditure. 
For example, firms with 250 or more employees 
created 88% of the total gross value in 200911 and 
the largest 10 R&D performers alone accounted  
for over a third of all manufacturing R&D. 

However, in recent years, the relative share of 
manufacturing in the UK economy has declined 
more rapidly than in other developed economies 
(Figure 112) while the service sector has grown 
at a faster rate. This growth of the service sector 
in the UK is consistent with growth in other 
developed economies13 including France and the 
US. This ‘deindustrialisation’ has also applied to UK 
manufacturing employment, with numbers reducing 

The future of manufacturing: A new era of opportunity and challenge for the UK

15

at a faster rate than in other developed economies, 
from close to nine million people in 1966 to below 
three million in 201114.

variabLe Performance reLative to 
internationaL comPetitors

UK manufacturing performance has been weak 
relative to international competitors in some 
key areas:

 Expenditure on manufacturing R&D has been 
low, especially with regard to new products. 15
  The level of investment in capital equipment has 
been relatively low for many decades. 16
 The UK’s share of global manufacturing exports 
has fallen from 7.2% in 1980 to 2.9% in 201217.

But there are also many outstanding individual 
firms, and some important areas of relatively 
strong performance for manufacturing as a whole:

 When total factor productivity is compared 
between the UK, the Netherlands, Spain, France, 
Italy and Germany, between 1980 and 2009, 
manufacturing performs best in the UK18.


 The fall in the UK’s share of goods exports has 
been accompanied by an increase in export 
intensity (manufacturing exports as a proportion 
of manufacturing output), which rose from about 
30% in 1991 to around 47% in 2011; which is 
similar to France and higher than the US19.

Development Organisation (UNIDO) (2013)

 

This study is unique within 
Europe both in terms of its scope  and 
its time frame which looks out to the year 
2050. It will help Nissan to tune its product 
offerings and production processes to better 
meet likely demographic and market trends. 
I am very encouraged by the efforts  
of the UK government to support 
manufacturing  and this report builds 
on the excellent Automotive and 
Aerospace industrial strategies recently 
published by the Department for 
Business, Innovation and Skills. 

The Foresight report has done 

an excellent job of identifying what 
manufacturing brings to our economy and 
what it can contribute in the future. There 
are some clear messages for government on 
how it can ensure that UK manufacturing 
is well placed to take advantage of these 
opportunities, particularly in supporting 
the development of new technologies. It 
is also important that manufacturers use 
this report to look at how well prepared 
they are for the challenges facing them 
in the coming decades.

and saLe of Products

Manufacturing has traditionally been understood 
as the production process in which raw materials 
are transformed into physical products20 through 
processes involving people and other resources.  
It is now clear that physical production is at the 
centre of a wider manufacturing value chain21.  
(Figure 2 and Box 1).

Manufacturers are increasingly using this wider 
value chain to generate new and additional revenue, 
with production playing a central role in allowing 
other value creating activities to occur. For example, 
39% of UK manufacturers with more than 100 
employees derived value from services related 
to their products in 2011, compared with 24% in 
2007 (Figure 3)25. This typically involves supporting 
or complementing products, and offering outcome 
or availability based contracts for products. Not 
all manufacturing firms report service revenue 
separately, and there is no requirement for them 
to do so. However, in 2009 Rolls Royce reported 
49% of its revenue from services, and Arcelor 
Mittal reported 29%.

‘The new era of manufacturing will be marked by highly agile, networked enterprises that use information and

Board, 2012)23.

‘The world is in the midst of a paradigm shift in the 21st century - one that integrates diverse sets of ideas, 
products and services globally through the lens of highly complex, integrated and self-morphing resource 
webs… Highly talented skilled people are necessary to effectively and consistently apply cutting edge science 
and technology, systems thinking, smart services and processes, and supply chain excellence’ (Deloitte, 2013)24.

New sources of revenue and of value creation 
will transform manufacturing business models 
over time. They will draw on new sources of 
knowledge and closer, long term relationships 
with customers. Future sources of revenue for 
manufacturers will include26: 

 Increasingly extensive packaging of services 
with products;
 New sources of information on how products 
are used, drawing on embedded sensors and 
open data;
 Becoming a ‘factoryless goods producer’, 
capturing value by selling technological 
knowledge and leaving production to others;
 Becoming a ‘remanufacturer’ with end of life 
products remanufactured and returned to 
original specifications or better;
 Targeting ‘collaborative consumption’, where 
no one customer owns a product outright;

 Creating value from new forms of (competitive) 
strategic alliance within and across sectors; and
 Exploiting new technologies more rapidly 
through greater operational capability coupled 
to entrepreneurial insight.

Summary Report

2. four KeY future 
characteristics of 
manufacturing and          
imPLications for 
government

Manufacturing is entering a dynamic 
new phase which will provide 
substantial opportunities for the UK. 
Looking ahead to 2050, this Foresight 
Project has identified four key future 
characteristics of manufacturing. They 
have significant implications for both 
Government and industry.

2.1. faster, more 
resPonsive and 
cLoser to  
customers

what are the LiKeLY changes?

Technology will play a central role in driving 
change. Some of the value being created in 
2050 will derive from wholly unanticipated 
breakthroughs but many of the technologies 
that will transform manufacturing, such as additive 
manufacturing , are already established or clearly 
emerging. Table 1 summarises some of the most 
important pervasive and secondary technologies 
including ICT, sensors, advanced materials and 
robotics. When integrated into future products 
and networks, these will collectively facilitate 
fundamental shifts in how products are designed, 
made, offered and ultimately used by consumers.

Mass personalisation of low-cost products, on 
demand: The historic split between cheap mass-
produced products creating value from economies 
of scale and more expensive customised products 
will be reduced across a wide range of product types. 
Technologies such as additive manufacturing, new 
materials, computer-controlled tools, biotechnology, 
and green chemistry will enable wholly new forms 
of personalisation. Direct customer input to design 

will increasingly enable companies to produce 
customised products with the shorter cycle-times 
and lower costs associated with standardisation and 
mass production. The producer and the customer  
will share in the new value created. For example, 
research at the University of Loughborough shows  
that customers might be prepared to pay an 
additional 10% for some degree of personalisation27. 
Customisation is a significant opportunity for UK 
manufacturers targeting both the domestic market  
and other developed economies. 

Distributed production: We will see a transformation 
in the nature of production itself, driven by trends 
such as new forms of modelling and additive 
manufacturing through to nanotechnologies and 
advanced robotics. The factories of the future will 
be more varied, and more distributed than those 
of today (Figure 4). The production landscape will 
include capital intensive super factories producing 
complex products; reconfigurable units integrated 
with the fluid requirements of their supply chain 
partners; and local, mobile and domestic production 
sites for some products. Urban sites will become 

Looking to the future, we 

recognise that transformational change is 
required and emerging technologies present 
an opportunity to create a paradigm shift, 
allowing us to manufacture medicines faster, 
greener and at a lower cost. Manufacturing 
has become increasingly critical in the 
pharmaceutical sector and will require 
more agility to respond to patient needs, 
more flexibility to bring production closer to 
customers, as well as increases in efficiency 
and sustainability. This will underpin  
high quality standards and ensure new 
medicines are affordable for patients around 
the world. The prize is significant and it is 
imperative that industry and Government 
work together to seize this opportunity  
and secure a leading position for the UK.

LiKeLY future imPacts

Modelling and simulation integrated into all design processes, together with virtual reality tools will allow 
complex products and processes to be assessed and optimised, with analysis of new data streams.

The integration of sensors into networks of technology, such as products connected to the internet, will revolutionise 
manufacturing. New data streams from products will become available to support new services, enable self-checking 
inventories and products which self diagnose faults before failure, and reduced energy usage.

Advanced & 
functional materials

New materials, in which the UK has strong capabilities, will penetrate the mass market and will include reactive 
nanoparticles, lightweight composites, self-healing materials, carbon nanotubes, biomaterials and ‘intelligent’ 
materials providing user feedback.

Biotechnology

The range of biotechnology products is likely to increase, with greater use of fields of biology by industry.  
There is potential for new disease treatment strategies, bedside manufacturing of personalised drugs, 
personalised organ fabrication, wide availability of engineered leather and meat, and sustainable production  
of fuel and chemicals.

Sustainable / green 
technologies

These will be used to reduce the resources used in production including energy and water, produce clean 
energy technologies, and deliver improved environmental performance of products. Minimising the use of 
hazardous substances.

These will be important in the on-going automation of many tasks that formerly required people. In addition, 
the volume and detail of information captured by businesses and the rise of multimedia, social medial and the 
internet of things will fuel future increases in data, allowing firms to understand customer preferences and 
personalise products.

There is potential for major impacts in terms of business optimisation, resource management, energy 
minimisation, and remote healthcare. In factory and process environments, virtually everything is expected  
to be connected via central networks. Increasingly, new products will have embedded sensors and  
become autonomous. 

Advances are likely to make many routine manufacturing operations obsolete, including: healthcare and 
surgery, food preparation and cleaning activities. Autonomous and near-autonomous vehicles will boost the 
development of computer vision, sensors including radar and GPS, and remote control algorithms.  
3D measurement and vision will be able to adapt to conditions, and track human gestures.

This is expected to have a profound impact on the way manufacturers make almost any product. It will 
become an essential ‘tool’ allowing designs to be optimised to reduce waste; products to be made as light as 
possible; inventories of spare parts to be reduced; greater flexibility in the location of manufacturing; products 
to be personalised to consumers; consumers to make some of their own products; and products to be made 
with new graded composition and bespoke properties.

Computerised manufacturing execution systems (MES) will work increasingly in real time to enable the control 
of multiple elements of the production process. Opportunities will be created for enhanced productivity, supply 
chain management, resource and material planning and customer relationship management.

Smart phones and similar devices are positioned to become ubiquitous, general purpose tools for managing 
supply chains, assets, maintenance and production. They will allow functions such as directed advertising, 
remote healthcare and personalisation of products. Linked technologies include battery technology, low  
energy displays, user interfaces, nano-miniaturisation of electronics, and plastic electronics.

Digitised manufacturing value chains: Pervasive 
computing, advanced software and sensor 
technologies have much further to go in 
transforming value chains. They will improve 
customer relationship management, process control, 
product verification, logistics, product traceability 
and safety systems. They will enable greater design 
freedom through the uses of simulation, and they 
will create new ways to bring customers into design 
and suppliers into complex production processes. 

what are the implications for 
government?

Improving the speed and co-ordination of the 
technology pipeline for UK manufacturing: Given the 
pace of change in technological developments and 
international competition, the UK needs to strengthen 
the extended system that identifies and supports new 
technologies and their applications. The UK’s High Value 
Manufacturing (HVM) Catapult Centre, established 
in 2011, has a key role in the near term, and is an 

example of a step that the Government has taken to 
develop a more systemic approach across research, 
innovation and industrial policy. 

Immediate priorities should be to scale up funding 
for the HVM Catapult Centre, to promote much 
stronger involvement of small and medium 
enterprises in the member centres, and to enhance 
the role it plays in connecting academic expertise 
to industry. Longer term, there is potential for 
the Centre to support international collaboration 
between manufacturers, for example by establishing 
a presence in key emerging  economies. 

Greater leveraging of the UK’s intellectual assets:  
The UK’s education system has considerable strengths 
relative to international competitors29. However it 
files fewer patents than countries such as US, Japan 
and Germany30. This suggests the UK is not leveraging 
its intellectual assets as much as it will need to in 
the future. For example, there needs to be a shift in 
the in balance of funding towards applied research 
and in its commercialisation. There also needs to be 
increased effort to identify key areas (such as sensors 
and additive manufacturing), to develop technology 
roadmaps, and to guide policy.

Summary Report

Protecting intellectual property, reducing 
counterfeiting and avoiding cyber-attacks:  
Digitisation increases the risks of objects being 
copied illegally. Technologies such as additive 
manufacturing may make it even harder to identify 
breaches29. However, the same trends support 
innovation and new forms of value creation. 
Today’s regulatory and policy frameworks need 
to be reappraised to ensure they achieve the 
best balance between openness and the rights 
and obligations of intellectual property ownership 
in this changing environment. They also need to 
consider what further action needs to be taken to 
address the threat of cyber-attack, which increasingly 
threatens information-rich products and services.

what are the Likely future trends?

Patterns of global trade and investment will 
determine the relative importance of the countries 
to which the UK exports and from which it imports; 
the types of firms and sectors which will be involved 
in its trade; the future structure and performance 
of manufacturing within the overall Balance of 
Payments; the place of the UK in the global pattern 
of foreign direct investment (FDI) flows; and the 
conduct of R&D and investment in innovation. 

Emergence of BRIC economies and the ‘Next-11’: 
BRIC economies (Brazil, Russia, India and China) are 
likely to become larger than the US by 2015 and 
the G7 by 2032. In addition, the ‘N-11’ economiesii 
are likely to become larger than the US and almost 
twice the size of the Euro area by 205031. By value, 
UK is low down the global list of exporters to 
China (24th) and India (21st). The UK is the world’s 
10th largest goods exporter, with a 2.9% share of 
global manufacturing exports in 2012. However its 
share of imports to countries forecast to be in the 
top 30 economies by 2050 is generally disappointing  
and below this level32. The UK’s relatively poor 
current placement in these markets will make it 
harder for it to benefit from their future growth. 

ii  Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Korea, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, 
Philippines, Turkey and Vietnam.

Continued importance of US and Europe for UK 
manufacturing exports: The UK exported to 226 
different countries or territories in 2010. The US 
was the most important destination, accounting for 
13% by value. In 2012, EU markets accounted for about 
54% of total export value, with BRIC exports at 8%. 

High-tech likely to remain an area of UK advantage: 
At 4.7%, the UK’s share of global high technology 
manufacturing exports is relatively strong. Current 
high-tech sectoral strengths include pharmaceuticals, 
aerospace, chemicals, and the automotive sector. 

Changing levels of personal wealth, including larger 
and older populations in major markets: The global 
population with annual per capita expenditure 
between US$3,650 and US$36,500 (2005 prices),  
is estimated to more than double in size from  
2 billion in 2012 to 5 billion in 203033. Asia’s share 
of the group will rise from 30% to 64%. There will 
be 3 billion more people in the world by 205034 
with 97% of population growth taking place in 
developing regions35. Populations in some major 
markets are growing significantly older, with the 
Asia-Pacific region having the oldest (Japan) and 
largest (China)36.

Risks to Foreign Direct Investment into Europe may 
affect the UK: The UK has been a major recipient 
of inward FDI for manufacturing and remains in a 
good position to attract an above-average share 
of FDI coming into Europe. However, FDI flows 
into Europe, as a proportion of total available FDI, 
are likely to reduce due to competition from BRIC 
and other emerging economies37. 

The international, 'industrial 
systems' view of manufacturing set out 
in this report points the way to creating 
and capturing value in a dynamic global 
economy. Meeting the implied challenges 
will require radical new approaches 
which cross traditional disciplinary and 
institutional boundaries.

Continued global fragmentation of the value chain: 
Fragmentation includes the outsourcing of functions 
and offshoring. It is driven by factors such as the 
costs and quality of labour and transport, security 
of provision, the opportunities created by trade 
liberalisation; the availability of data and information; 
and the integration of suppliers into product 
development processes. Many manufacturing value 
chains are likely to continue to fragment, with the 
operation of supply chains playing a major role in 
determining future changes38. 

Some onshoring of production back to the UK: 
Onshoring (or ‘reshoring’) is a recent trend typically 
involving the repatriation of production from low 
cost locations; investment in onshore production 
to enhance capability; and sourcing of components 
from onshore, rather than from overseas. This is 
typically in response to changing labour costs, higher 
transport costs, a need to be closer to the market, 
product quality concerns, and advantages of co-
locating R&D and production39. There is little robust 
evidence about the scale of this trend so far (see 
Box 2 for illustrations)40. However, some underlying 
trends suggest it will become increasingly possible 
for the UK to compete with lower cost locations, 
on quality, delivery speed and customisation. 

The quickest-acting and  

highest-octane fuel for growth in 
any economy, is a blisteringly strong 
export performance. The challenge 
for UK manufacturing is to recognise 
what things we’re especially good at, 
embrace them and drive them forward, 
by investing time, money and skills 
in them. We should acknowledge our 
strengths, and play to them.

Increasing foreign ownership: If current trends 
continue, the foreign-owned manufacturing sector 
within the UK will account for a larger share of 
output (by 2020), GVA and employment (by 2015) 
than the UK-owned sector41. The presence of multi-
national corporations (MNCs) will continue to 
help improve the performance of the UK’s largest 
firms, but the detail of the effects depends on the 
investment and production strategies of MNCs.

box 2: examPLes of uK onshoring
John Lewis plc: During July 201342, the retailer 
emphasised its commitment to increasing sales of 
products manufactured in the UK by announcing a 
two-year 15 per cent growth target for all sales of 
goods in its shops that are made in the UK. In addition, 
it has increased its number of UK suppliers from 132 
in  2012 to 207 in 2013. 

Hornby plc: In November 201243 the UK model 
maker decided to return the production of 60% of its 
model paint brand, Humbrol, from China to the UK. 
This decision was taken to improve supply, and ensure 
high quality standards continue to be met, but from an 
easier location nearer to the Margate Head Office. 

Laxtons Ltd: This spinning company, established in 1907, 
is now a design-driven yarn manufacturer. Like many 
British textile companies, production was offshored, 
but it has now returned to Yorkshire, reducing the 
firm’s carbon footprint and lead times and increasing 
its control over quality and raw materials.

Bathrooms.com: In July 201344, the online bathroom 
specialist confirmed that it was handing 50% of the 
contracts currently held by Chinese manufacturers to 
UK businesses in the Midlands, to decrease the time 
taken from design through to production from four 
to six months to six weeks.

Marks & Spencer plc: In October 201345, the 
retailer launched its Best of British collection selling 
womenswear and menswear collections which 
emphasise British craftsmanship and quality, which 
feature a combination of British heritage, sourcing 
and production. This was part of a three-year deal 
with the British Fashion Council to support domestic 
talent and increase its sourcing from the UK.

Summary Report

what are the imPLications for 
government?

Enabling UK manufacturers to control global value 
chains: As manufacturing value chains continue to 
fragment globally, and new business models such as 
manufacturing services continue to develop, it will 
become increasingly important for manufacturers 
to create and operate value chains to maximise 
revenues46. Government action in support of 
this needs to be agile and outward looking, and 
informed by a common view of developments 
which draws upon intelligence from BIS, Research 
Councils and the Technology Strategy Board. 
A recent example of such action is a funding 
competition launched by the Technology Strategy 
Board this year; this supports feasibility studies 
into new business models which in turn promote 
innovations in high value manufacturing47.

Promoting co-location of R&D with production to 
maintain and build an ‘industrial commons’iii Products 
dependent on process-driven innovation, such as 
some drugs, nano-materials and some electronics 
applications benefit from the co-location of different 
parts of their production systems (Figure 5)48. 
Government has a major role to play, nationally 
and locally, in encouraging greater agglomeration 
and clustering of particular activities, including 
encouraging co-location of production alongside 
research and development.

iii Industrial commons: The embedded knowledge and technology 
framework that enhances the efficiency, effectiveness, and productivity 
of the proprietary capital and labour that use it.

Raising the UK’s export performance, particularly to 
emerging economies: Products win export markets 
when they deliver value, rarity, and possess hard-
to-imitate attributes49. Most exporting is done by 
firms with relatively high levels of productivity, so 

PROCESS-EMBEDDED INNOVATION 
Process technologies, though mature, are still 
highly integral to product innovation. Subtle 
changes in process can alter the product’s 
characteristics in unpredictable ways. Design 
cannot be separated from manufacturing.
Examples: craft products, high-end wine, 
high-end apparel, heat-treated metal 
fabrication, advanced materials fabrication, 
speciality chemicals.

PROCESS-DRIVEN INNOVATION
Major process innovations are evolving 
rapidly and can have a huge impact on 
the product. The value of integrating R&D 
and manufacturing is extremely
high. The risks of separating design and 
manufacturing are enormous. 
Examples: biotech drugs, nanomaterials, 
OLED and electrophoretic displays, 
superminiaturized assembly.

PURE PRODUCT INNOVATION
The processes are mature, and the 
value of integrating product design 
with manufacturing is low. Outsourcing 
manufacturing makes sense. 
Examples: desktop computers, consumer 
electronics, active pharmaceutical ingredients, 
commodity semiconductors.

PURE PROCESS INNOVATION
Process technology is evolving rapidly but 
is not intimately connected to product 
innovation. Locating design near 
manufacturing isn’t critical. 
Examples: advanced semiconductors, 
high-density flexible circuits.

measures to raise this, for example by improving 
the quality of leadership and management, will be 
key. The role of UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) 
will also continue to be important and should be 
strengthened in markets offering the best potential 
for export growth. This includes the provision of 
advice and market-based intelligence to companies 
seeking to increase their exports or enter new 
markets, and support to businesses once they 
are operating in a market, for example in areas of 
language and culture. Beyond these measures, there 
is a need to understand much better what prevents 
the UK from having more exporting ‘superstars’ - 
firms which export ten or more products to ten 
or more destinations. 

Identifying ‘phoenix’ industries emerging from 
previous manufacturing activities: Established 
industrial regions typically possess important legacy 
assets such as specialised engineering skills, pre-
existing personal networks, technical skills, and 
market knowledge50. National and local policy-
makers will need to develop new mechanisms 
to identify and exploit these legacies to support 
phoenix industries, such as small and medium-
sized firms specialising in the production of high 
value sophisticated components for equipment 
manufacturers. Success will depend on strong 

local alliances, such as those behind specialised 
training and research programmes run by 
Sheffield University51 and other universities. 

Keeping the UK attractive to manufacturing FDI: 
Three attributes that make the UK attractive to 
overseas investors include quality of life, culture 
and language; the stable political environment; 
and technology and infrastructure52. Priorities for 
attracting future FDI for manufacturing include 
the provision of high quality e-infrastructure and 
physical infrastructure (roads53, in particular).

Ensuring a supply of patient capital: UK capital 
markets are characterised by an arms-length 
relationship between the providers and users of 
finance. An emphasis on short term returns by 
investors leads to management focus on short-
term movements in stock market prices, and the 
threat of takeover, with long term investment in 
new capital equipment, skills and training and R&D 
spend inhibited. These effects are damaging for 
manufacturing, which requires relatively high long 
term investment in terms of new capital equipment, 
R&D and skills54. The institutional architecture which 
encourages impatience in corporate governance and 
the capital market must be addressed to support 
future UK manufacturing competitiveness.

Summary Report

2.3 More  
sustainable

What are the likely future trends?

Participants at the project’s international workshops 
repeatedly emphasised the profound changes that 
environmental sustainabilityiv will have on production 
processes over the next four decades. Figure 6 
outlines these in three broad phases.

 iv  The terms ‘sustainable manufacturing’ and the ‘drive towards 

sustainability’ are frequently used in the Foresight work. The definition 
of sustainability adopted here is that described in the widely cited 
Brundtland Report: ‘development that meets the needs of the present 
without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their 
own needs’.

Volatility of supply: A growing global population 
and increased urbanisation (70% of the global 
population will live in urban areas in 2050)55 will 
increase demand for materials, water, energy 
and land. As a result, resources will be subject to 

greater competition, with potential disruptions in 
their supply. In most cases, prices will rise and they 
may also become more volatile. Those companies 
and nations that learn how to manufacture their 
products with less of these inputs will be more 
resilient to these effects.

Climate change and the increased vulnerability of 
global supply chains: Climate change will have a 
range of impacts including raising sea levels and 
extreme weather events56. UK manufacturers will 
be affected by challenges such as the disruption 
of their international supply chains. 

Greater use of regulation, potential ‘pricing of 
the environment’: Regulation is likely to focus 
increasingly on promoting resource productivity. 
For example, recent EU legislation aims to 
divert electrical equipment waste away from 
landfill. Over the period to 2050, national and 
international responses are likely to include tougher 
environmental standards for products and new ways 
to price natural resources and ecosystem services.

box 3: examPLes of firms embracing 
the ‘circuLar economY’
Caterpillar Inc.: Caterpillar is a US manufacturer 
of construction and mining equipment, diesel and 
natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines and 
diesel-electric trains, with a strong UK presence. 
The business runs ‘Cat Reman’, a remanufacturing 
programme that returns products at the end of 
their lives to same-as-new condition, and seeks new 
ways to reduce, reuse, recycle, and reclaim materials 
which once would have gone into a landfill. During 
2012, Cat Reman took back over 2.2 million end-of-
life units for remanufacturing63.

JC Bamford Excavators Ltd (JCB): JCB is one of the 
world's top three manufacturers of construction 
equipment, based in the UK. Through the JCB 
Service Exchange, the business helps plant users 
to reduce owning and operating costs, with a 
comprehensive range of remanufactured parts for 
all its machines. Around 1650 high quality parts, all 
remanufactured to Original Equipment Manufacturer 
standards and protected by the same warranty 
conditions as new parts, are offered. With typical 
savings against new of 40-50%, the remanufactured 
parts can restore machines to their optimum 
condition at a more affordable price. Furthermore, 
remanufactured parts are upgraded to incorporate 
the latest technology64.

Consumer pull for eco-products: Consumer 
demand for sustainable products which use less 
energy and fewer materials is growing57, although 
it is not clear how far and fast demand will change. 
Unilever’s pledge to double turnover without 
increasing greenhouse gas emissions58 and Marks & 
Spencer’s Plan A to go ‘beyond compliance’ on the 
environment59 are examples of corporate responses.

Making robust products for ‘collaborative 
consumption’60: ICT-based systems are facilitating 
new business models based on shared use of assets. 
This shifts the business model from ownership to 
access, incentivises manufacturers to provide robust 
products, and allows the creation of new service 
based revenue streams. 

Emergence of a ‘circular economy’ in which end of life 
products are reused, remanufactured and recycled: 
Resource scarcity and higher costs for energy and 
waste disposal will shift manufacturing value creation 
to new models (Figure 7 and Box 3)61:

 Reuse: Redeploying a product without the need 
for refurbishment;
 Remanufacturing: Returning a product to its

 Cascaded use: Using a product for a lower value 
purpose, for example turning used clothes into 
pillow stuffing or redeploying computers within 
a business for less demanding applications;
 Recycling: Extracting the raw materials and using  
them for new products;
 Recovery: Re-using materials for a low value 
purpose such as road base or combustion to 
produce heat62.

The future of manufacturing: A new era of opportunity and challenge for the UK28

Summary Report

what are the imPLications for 
government?

Incentivising product and process efficiency:  
Greater use should be made of well designed 
regulation, in particular drawing upon ideas from 
abroad. For example, effective energy reduction 
has been demonstrated by innovative schemes 
such as ‘Top-Runner’ in Japan65 where future 
product standards are set so that all products 
manufactured at a specific point in the future 
must be at least as good as the best performance 
of today. The Government should consider 
developing top-runner schemes in the UK, for 
example relating to the energy usage of factories, 
and also procurement and waste policies. 

Targeting R&D at improving resource efficiency  
and material substitution: The UK has world  
class capabilities in key areas of research in novel 
material design and development. Continued 
support for fundamental research should be 
complemented by programmes to develop 

rapid recycling and recovery technologies, with 
non-destructive removal of high value parts and 
materials from complex end-of-life products. 

Supporting business models based on reuse 
remanufacturing and services: Government 
should work with industry and others, for 
example in the UK such as the Royal Society 
for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures 
and Commerce (RSA) and the Ellen MacArthur 
Foundation66 to accelerate the development  
and roll out of the ‘circular economy’. Lessons 
should also be drawn from overseas organisations 
such as the 2009 China ‘Circular Economy 
Promotion Law’. 

Quantifying domestic reserves of critical materials: 
It is essential that the UK makes the most of 
any domestic supplies of key materials, where 
economically viable, such as sources of indium, 
widely used in the production of LCD displays 
and low-melting temperature alloys.

of high quality skills will allow developed economies 
such as the UK to increasingly compete in terms of 
the quality of their workforce. 

A need to improve the perception of manufacturing 
amongst young people and women 68, 69 and to 
raise the quality of UK managers: Young people 
and women tend to have a negative perception 
of manufacturing, with 67% of girls aged 7-11 
years indicated that they would not like a job 
in manufacturing compared with 44% of boys70. 
In addition, the UK currently fares poorly on 
the quality of its managers71: average scores for 
management practices in surveys of manufacturing 
in different countries show that Great Britain 
scores below the US, Japan, Germany, Sweden, and 
Canada, but is on a par with Australia, Italy and 
France. Strong leadership teams and distributed 
leaders in key positions throughout manufacturing 
businesses will be essential in the future. 

The potential for human enhancement:  
By 2050 patterns of employment will be 
influenced by new forms of human enhancement 
and augmented capabilities72. These may support 
mental performance and physical mobility, and 
help counter the effects of ageing.

worKers

what are the LiKeLY future trends?

Sustained future demand for manufacturing workers: 
UK manufacturing employment has declined 
significantly in the past (from around 9 million 
people in 1966 compared with less than 3 million 
in 2011). Any future declines will be much smaller, 
with around 170,000 fewer people in the sector 
projected by 2020 compared with 2010. However, 
there will be around 800,000 jobs to fill in the years 
up to 2020, as people retire or leave manufacturing.

An ageing population and the need to accommodate 
more older workers: Over the period to 2050, 
the UK will have an ageing population, with the 
number of people aged 65 years and over (i.e. of 
‘traditional’ retirement age) set to increase, while 
the numbers of ‘traditional’ working age people are 
set to decrease. By 2030, 17% of the UK population 
will be aged between 60-74. There will be a number 
of challenges in making manufacturing attractive 
to older workers, particularly in sub-sectors with 
the oldest age profiles including manufacturing of 
machinery and fabricated metal products. 

Science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) 
qualifications: By 2020 there are expected to be 
an additional 80,000 managerial, professional and 
associate professional and technical positions in 
manufacturing. Overall, many jobs will require 
apprentice, degree and technician level STEM 
qualifications, especially in product design and 
development. Future demand is currently likely to 
exceed supply especially as, at present, only around 
a quarter of engineering and technology graduates 
work in manufacturing six months after graduation.

Demand for technical specialism combined with 
commercial and problem solving abilities: The 
precise mix of skills in demand for the factories of 
the future will vary by sub-sector (see Table 2)67, 
but new blends of skills will increase manufacturers’ 
ability to exploit new opportunities. These blends 

The future of manufacturing: A new era of opportunity and challenge for the UK30

Summary Report

what are the imPLications for 
government?

Increasing and diversifying the supply of 
manufacturing workers to avoid future shortfalls: 
There is a need to consistently reach out 
to young people in the education system to 
encourage them to study STEM subjects to keep 
their future options open; focusing on accessing and 
attracting international talent for example through 
‘science visas’; and building and maintaining existing 
workforce capability for example by encouraging 
continual vocational education and training.

Equipping future workers with high quality skills 
that manufacturers will need: potential workers 
will need to be as high quality and ‘business ready’ 
as possible, to meet the need for new skills sets 
driven by changing business models, technology 
and other factors. Higher level skills, vocational 
training, apprenticeships and STEM qualifications 
will be critical as the manufacturing workforce 
shifts to include a greater proportion of managerial, 
professional and technical roles. Government will 
need to increase the scale and ambition of its 
programme of current initiatives to meet these 
future requirements.

Ensuring that manufacturers utilise future workers 
effectively: this will involve raising employer demand 
for skills to stimulate a supply which meets future 
needs as closely as possible; and employers designing 
jobs that exploit new skills and capabilities for 
competitive advantage. 

A common theme of all the future 

trends is the need for a highly talented, 
skilled and flexible workforce. We must 
do more to achieve a higher percentage 
of young people going into Science and 
Engineering and counter the current poor 
perception of Manufacturing industries. 
Manufacturing local to your consumers 
to deliver exceptional value is a trend 
we already see in the Food and Drink 
sector. Understanding the complete value 
chain (e.g. from farm to fork) will enable 
businesses to deliver increased value to 
customers and consumers.

Manufacturing is no longer just about ‘production’ - 
making a product and then selling it. Manufacturers 
are increasingly using a wider ‘value chain’ to 
generate new and additional revenue from pre and 
post production activities, with production playing a 
critical role in allowing these other activities to occur. 

New metrics are needed to capture the new ways

pilot the development of new metrics focused 
on the value chain (Box 4). These will be critical 
in revealing key interconnections in the economy, 
understanding the important role of production 
in the manufacturing value chain, and helping to 
identify where in the value chain future policy 
intervention should focus to support manufacturers 
as they create and capture new and additional 
revenue streams. New metrics will also help in 
developing an understanding of how policies in 
other areas affect manufacturing.

box 4: new waYs to measure 
manufacturing?

The performance of the manufacturing sector is 
currently measured by classifying the output of 
manufacturing firms by the main type of economic 
activity in which they are engaged73 with the 
Office for National Statistics using the Standard 
Industrial Classification (SIC) system. This provides 
a limited and incomplete picture since it captures 
neither the wider manufacturing value chain nor 
the incorporation within the firm of pre- and 
post-production services which are increasingly 
important in competitive business models for 
manufacturing firms. 

The Office for National Statistics collects limited 
data relating to the type of goods and services 
bought-in by firms, and to which broad sectors 
goods and services are sold. This allows them 
to construct Supply-and-Use and Input-Output 
tables for the UK74 which show in aggregate  
the flow of goods and services along the supply 
chain. However, it is not possible to use these 
data to measure which ‘core’ products also 
involve ‘manufacturing-dependent’ pre- and  
post-production goods and services. 

Achieving this would require access to data relating 
to individual firm data, with information not only 
on what goods and services are bought-in and to 
whom output is sold but also on which plants and 
firms supply and purchase these goods and services. 
Such detailed information is not currently available. 
The ONS could lead a pilot looking at innovative 
ways to use existing and future potential data 
sources to develop finer grained models of activity 
in support of policy making.

3.2. targeting  
sPecific stages of 
the manufacturing 
vaLue chain

taKing a more targeted aPProach 
to supporting vaLue creation

Future industrial policies, informed by updated 
metrics (see above), will need to complement 
strategic approaches to individual sectors by 
allowing for a wider variety of types of targeted 
interventions. This provides an opportunity for 
developing the current Government approach to 
industrial strategy. New measures, tailored to specific 
requirements of manufacturing sub-sectors and the 
technologies upon which successful future business 
models will be built, should include, for example:

 Facilitating the emergence of challenger 
businesses. These exploit new business models 
and cross cutting approaches in technologies, 
across sub-sectors, to drive ‘disruptive growth’ in 
manufacturing. For example, support might focus 
on businesses with strong design capabilities 
specialising in additive manufacturing technology, 
which collaborate with others to work across 
manufacturing sub-sectors; 
 Enhancing UK capabilities that cannot easily 
be relocated abroad. This is particularly 
important given the increasing ease with which 
manufacturing activities and the different 
elements of value chains can now be relocated 
around the world. Further promotion of R&D 
clusters and their co-location with production 
and the science base is one possible measure;
 Supporting the creation of new revenue streams 
from manufacturing services. For example this 
includes capitalising upon knowledge generated 
by sensors embedded in products; 
 Helping manufacturers to expand their 
capabilities in remanufacturing and 
resource efficiency; and 

Meeting these requirements will involve a move 
towards a coordinated systems based rationale for 
the design and delivery of the UK’s industrial policy.

a sYstems based aPProach for 
the  future 

Future approaches to policy depend strongly 
on recognising that manufacturing is part of an 
extended system, which requires a response from 
Government that cuts across policy departments. 

This requires a ‘systems based’ approach that 
takes full account of the linkage between science, 
technology, innovation and industrial policies. 
The result is the need for more integrated 
coordination by government across policy 
domains and Government departments, that 
makes it easier to anticipate the potential 
unintended consequences of policies, and to 
identify where intervention would achieve the 
greatest impact. Such an approach should help 
to avoid the adoption of selective policies based 
on narrow objectives that might inadvertently 
hold back sustainable growth, and which are 
more a feature of the current approach which 
devolves policy-making to different government 
departments with different roles and agendas. 

The evidence collected by this Project suggests 
that the greatest future need will be to remedy 
‘systems failures’ that affect the rapid emergence 
and uptake of new, cross-cutting technologies. 
The future policy system must ensure that the 
most valuable new technologies are not missed, 
and needs to work with researchers, industry 
experts and policy-makers so that government 
initiatives collectively support them. In practice, 
this will mean developing new ways to support 
emerging technologies, including sophisticated 
use of roadmapping to identify what is needed 
to support technological change.

Summary Report

3.3. enhancing  
government  
caPabiLitY in  
evaLuating and  
coordinating  
PoLicY over the 
Long term

It is essential that institutional structures 
within Government respond to changes in the 
manufacturing sector so that they can deliver the 
integrated systems approach which is advocated 
to enable more effective policy delivery and 
evaluation. This can be helped by promoting a 
better sharing of understanding and intelligence 
between the Department for Business Innovation 
and Skills and the Technology Strategy Board – in 
effect a shift in balance from sponsorship towards 
knowledge transfer. 

A new institutional architecture can also help. 
A particular issue here is developing policy with 
a longer term perspective independent of the 
instabilities produced by the electoral cycle. 
Examples of where this has been achieved in other 
areas of policy include: an independent Bank of 
England to implement monetary policy, the National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to 
advise the NHS on the take-up of new treatments, 
and the removal of ministerial discretion with 
regard to cases investigated by the Competition 
Commission. However, this has not generally been 
the case with regard to industrial policy. 

In considering future industrial policy towards 
manufacturing and any related institutional 
reforms, it is recommended that close attention 
be paid to developments in other countries. 
These are consistent with the general arguments 
advanced in this Section. These examples are of the 
US Advance Manufacturing National Programme 
Office (AMNPO) (see Box 5), the Australian 
Productivity Commission (APC), and the UK 
Independent Commission for Aid Impact (ICAI).

Building on insights from these examples there is 
a clear need for future Government capability in 
evaluating and coordinating policy over the long 
term to be strengthened. The UK Government 
should create an ‘Office for Manufacturing’. 
which would:

 

 

 

 

 Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of industrial 
policies relevant to manufacturing;
 Identify relevant international best practice and 
highlight this to Government; 
 Ensure the collation and effective use of the 
new best practice metrics for manufacturing 
(see above), also drawing in intelligence on 
manufacturing value chains from the wider public 
sector including Research Councils and the 
Technology Strategy Board; and
 Advise on where cross Government 
coordination can be strengthened and simplified.

Summary Report

4. concLusions

PreParing for the future:
This Foresight Report looks out to 2050 and 
describes the transformation which will occur  
in the manufacturing sector and the environment  
in which it operates. 

These changes will present major opportunities  
for the UK to develop competitive strengths in 
new and existing areas, but they will also present 
considerable challenges and threats, not least 
through increases in global competition. It will be 
essential for Government and industry to work 
together to forge new policy frameworks and 
develop measures so that manufacturing  
is able to fulfil its full potential for contributing to  
UK economic growth and prosperity, and in 
rebalancing the economy.

Together, the proposed measures put forward 
in this Report build on the current industrial 
and sector-specific strategies, emphasising that 
Government will need to significantly strengthen 
its future approach to ensuring a strong and 
resilient manufacturing sector.:

government needs to act in three 
sYstemic areas to:
 

 exploit new forms of intelligence to gain sharper 
insights into the sector and where value is being 
created; 
 take a more targeted approach to supporting 
manufacturers, based on a system-wide 
understanding of science, technology, innovation 
and industrial policies; and 
 adapt and build innovative new institutional 
capability for the future. 

 

 

PoLicies and measures aLso need  
to be deveLoPed to suPPort 
manufacturing as it becomes:
 
 
  more sustainable; and 
 

faster, more responsive and closer to customers; 
exposed to new market opportunities; 

increasingly dependent on highly skilled workers. 

further worK: 
The work in preparing this report has revealed 
issues affecting not only manufacturing but industry 
in general in the UK. As immediate follow up, it 
is recommended the Government commissions 
detailed comparative studies into: 

 

 

 

 the role of institutional infrastructures and 
systems in supporting industry; 
the need for inreasing the availability and quality 
of long term (or patient) capital; and  
 the role of a national belief in value creation in 
facilitating industrial success.

next stePs
 The Report and its supporting evidence propose 
a wide range of specific insights and potential 
actions for the public and private sectors to explore. 
These will need to be considered in the round, and 
the UK will need to adapt if it is to avoid being left 
behind. Many examples of new support initiatives 
and policy development have been identified in 
competitor countries.

it has been important to take a long-term and strategic 
look at the future of manufacturing at this particular time.
It sets out themes which have been explored, and the 
areas in which advice is provided. 

The future of manufacturing: A new era of opportunity and challenge for the UK42

1. Introduction

1.1 aims of the 
ProJect

The Project aim has been to take a strategic look at 
manufacturing out to 2050, in order to:

 

 

Identify and analyse important drivers of change 
affecting the UK manufacturing sector; 
Identify the challenges and opportunities that lie 
ahead and which require action by Government 
and firms; and

  Advise how Government policy needs to evolve 

so that it is better positioned to support the 
growth and resilience of UK manufacturing over 
coming decades. 

This report is primarily aimed at decision makers in 
Government. However, the Project, together with its 
underpinning evidence base1 contains much that will 
be of direct interest to businesses. Individual firms 
will need to assess how changes in the decades 
ahead are likely to affect them and to act where 
needed. Importantly, those who do not act risk 
failure given the scale of the new challenges and 
increasing global competition.

1.2 whY the ProJect 
was undertaKen at 
this time

A diverse sector with a context of historical shifts 

The UK manufacturing sector is diverse2, with 
activities ranging from aerospace, pharmaceuticals, 
chemicals and automotives to food and drink (see 
Figure 1.1)3. Although most manufacturing firms are 
small (see Figure 1.2)4, with 87% of firms employing 
1-19 employees in 2009, large and often foreign-
owned firms generate most of the value-added 
and dominate research and development (R&D) 
expenditure. For example, firms with 250 or more

employees created 88% of the total gross value in 
2009 and the largest 10 R&D performers alone 
accounted for over a third of all manufacturing R&D. 

In recent years, the relative share of manufacturing 
in the UK economy has declined more rapidly than 
in other developed economies (Figure 1.3)5, from 
30% in the early 1970s to 10% in 20116, while 
the service sector has grown at a faster rate. This 
growth of the service sector in the UK is consistent 
with growth in other developed economies 
including France and the US7. This ‘deindustrialisation’ 
has also applied to UK manufacturing employment, 
with numbers reducing at a faster rate than in other 
developed economies, from close to nine million 
people in 1966 to below three million in 20118.

Variable performance relative to international 
competitors

UK manufacturing performance has been weak 
relative to international competitors in some  
key areas:

 

Expenditure on manufacturing R&D has been 
low, especially with regard to new products9;

  The level of investment in capital equipment has 

been relatively low for many decades10; and

  The UK’s share of global manufacturing exports 
has fallen from 7.2% in 1980 to 2.9% in 201211.
There are also many outstanding individual firms, 
and some important areas of relatively strong 
performance for manufacturing as a whole:

When Total Factor Productivity (TFP) is compared 
between the UK, the Netherlands, Spain, France, Italy 
and Germany, from 1980 to 2009, manufacturing 
performs best in the UK12;

  The fall in the UK’s share of goods exports has 
been accompanied by an increase in the export 
intensity (manufacturing exports as a proportion 
of manufacturing output), which rose from about 
30% in 1991 to around 47% in 2011, similar to 
France and higher than the US13. 

A powerful contribution to the UK economy

Whilst some of these figures are sometimes 
considered as clear indicators of the UK 
manufacturing sector being in inexorable decline, 
this is untrue. In assessing the role of manufacturing, 
it is important to go beyond its direct share of GVA 
and employment. Evidence shows a more complex 
picture, emphasising that manufacturing is and must 
continue to be an essential part of the UK economy, 
with diverse benefits including14:

  Absolute value: The contribution of 

 

manufacturing to UK GDP (£139 billion in  
2012) is still significant15 and has been 
increasing over the long term16.
Exports: Manufacturing businesses are more 
likely to engage in exporting. UK exports of 
goods produced by the manufacturing sector 
totalled £256 billion in 2012, accounting for 
around 53% of all UK exports17. In 2010, 60% 
of manufacturing businesses with ten or more 
employees exported products and services 
compared to 26% of non-manufacturers18.

The future of manufacturing: A new era of opportunity and challenge for the UK44

1. Introduction

  R&D: Manufacturing businesses with ten or 

  The factories of the future will be more varied, 

more employees are more likely to engage in 
R&D. 41% of manufacturing businesses allocated 
resources to R&D in 2010 compared to an 
average of 23% of businesses in other sectors. 
Throughout 2000-2011, 72%-79% of total UK 
business R&D expenditure was associated 
with manufacturing19. 
Innovation: Manufacturers are more likely 
to innovate. In 2010, 26% of manufacturing 
businesses with ten or more employees 
carried out process innovation compared to 
less than 14% for non-manufacturers, and 44% 
undertook product innovation (less than 26% 
for non-manufacturers20. 

 

  Productivity: The growth in TFP21 for 

manufacturing has been 2.3% per year between 
1980 and 2009, compared with 0.7% per year 
for the UK as a whole22.

  Highly skilled jobs: In 2011, remuneration in UK 

manufacturing was 10% higher in comparable 
occupations compared to the average across 
all industries, reflecting the high levels of skills 
required in modern manufacturing roles23. 
Inter-industry linkages: Manufacturing 
performance affects other sectors through its 
wide range of input-output and other linkages24.
Economic resilience: Economies with strong, 
export-led manufacturing sectors typically 
recover from recessions faster than those 
without equivalent manufacturing sectors25.

 

 

Manufacturing is entering a critical period

Manufacturing in the UK and the wider global 
manufacturing ecosystem will be faced with new 
or ongoing changes in a number of areas over the 
decades ahead. These changes (see Chapters 2-6), 
will combine to create major opportunities, and 
challenges, for manufacturers. For example:

  Manufacturing is evolving beyond simply making 

a product and then selling it. Manufacturers 
are increasingly using a wider value chain26 to 
embrace new sources of revenue, which will 
transform business models over time.

and less spatially concentrated than those 
of today. The production landscape is likely 
to include capital-intensive super-factories 
producing complex products; reconfigurable 
units integrated with the fluid requirements of 
their supply chain partners; and local, mobile and 
domestic production sites for some products. 
Urban sites will become common as factories 
reduce their environmental impacts27. The factory 
of the future may be at the bedside, in the home, 
in the field, in the office and in the battlefield.

  There will be significant changes globally in 

the levels of personal wealth, with larger and 
older populations in major markets. The ‘global 
middle-class’ with annual per capita expenditure 
between US$3,650 and US$36,500, is estimated 
to more than double in size from 2 billion in 
2012 to 5 billion in 2030. Asia’s share of the 
group will rise from 30% to 64%28. There will be 
3 billion more people in the world by 205029 
with 97% of population growth by 2050 taking 
place in developing regions30. Populations in 
some major markets are growing older, with the 
Asia-Pacific region having the oldest (Japan) and 
largest (China)31.

  Resource scarcity and higher costs for energy 

and waste disposal will shift manufacturing value 
creation to new models, with greater emphasis 
on reusing products and remanufacturing 
products to original performance specification.

  To be successful in high-value manufacturing, 
the UK and other developed economies will 
increasingly need to compete using the quality 
of their workforces. Demand for workers with 
new skill sets, including deep technical specialism 
combined with commercial and problem-solving 
abilities, will emerge, with the precise mix of skills 
in demand for the factories of the future varying 
by sub-sector.
Shocks at local, regional and international scales 
will present particular challenges both for 
manufacturers in the UK, their overseas supply 
chains, and customer demand. For example, 
extreme weather events fuelled by climate 
change may disrupt vulnerable global supply 
chains, and future advanced and information-rich 
products may be particularly vulnerable to  
cyber-attack.

in the direct inputs used to produce goods and services (i.e. labour, physical capital and intermediate inputs). Rather it is the more efficient use of these

Three systemic areas for future Government focus: 
As manufacturing evolves, policy makers will need 
new approaches to ensure that the UK is a place 
where it also increasingly thrives. The Report analysis 
argues the need for Government to (Chapter 7):

  Obtain more rigorous information about  
how manufacturing is changing and how it  
is creating value;

  Take a more targeted approach to supporting 

manufacturing, by adopting a systems based 
approach to science, technology, innovation  
and industrial policy; and

  Adapt and build institutional capacity, potentially 

in the form of an Office for Manufacturing. 

It is important to emphasise that this Report 
discusses policy measures likely to be effective in the 
future, given the areas of change and uncertainty 
identified. It does not, therefore, seek to evaluate the 
performance of past and present policies. However, 
in places, the advice provided by this Report takes 
existing plans, priorities and initiatives as a starting 
point. Additionally, the project builds on previous 
Foresight work in this area looking out to 2020 
as a backdrop to developing an understanding of 
manufacturing in the decades ahead out to 205033 34.

A key message is that over coming decades, 
diverse changes will play out in a world that will 
be increasingly wealthy, urban and interconnected. 
The result will be unprecedented opportunities, 
as well as significant threats to manufacturing 
businesses. Businesses will need to rise to these 
challenges or fail. However, the threats should not 
be overstated. The strengths in UK manufacturing 
activities provide a broad foundation on which to 
build resilience and ultimately success. 

1.3 how the 
worK has been 
structured

The past, the present, and a modern lens:  
The starting point for this Project has been to 
review the changing nature of UK manufacturing 
activities and their role in creating value. This 
provides important insights into how manufacturing 
is currently understood and measured, and how this 
might need to change in the future (Chapter 2).

Four key future characteristics of manufacturing 
and implications for Government: The Report 
has investigated key changes affecting UK 
manufacturing – out to 2050 where possible – 
to provide a comprehensive perspective on long-
term change. Individually, these drivers point to 
significant shifts and uncertainties in the future 
landscape in which manufacturing will operate. 
International workshops involving senior industry 
and academic experts in Europe, the United 
States, and Asia have been used to test these 
results32. The evidence is presented as four future 
characteristics of manufacturing, and is accompanied 
by discussion of the implications for Government: 

 

Faster, more responsive and closer to customers 
(Chapter 3);
Exposed to new market opportunities (Chapter 4);

 
  More sustainable (Chapter 5); and
 

Increasingly dependent on highly skilled workers 
(Chapter 6).

This Chapter looks at how manufacturing is currently 
understood and how it might change in the future. 
This includes discussion of the manufacturing value 
chain and factors which will drive changes including 
innovation in business models and technology, and 
the role of manufacturing in the wider business 
environment (Section 2.1).

The Chapter also examines the significant contributions 
manufacturing makes to the UK economy, particularly in 
terms of innovation, productivity, trade, and high quality 
jobs (Section 2.2). 

These factors are used to argue the need to adopt a more 
integrated view of manufacturing for the 21st century, 
and the strategic importance of ‘new manufacturing’ for 
the future economy.

Key messages:

Manufacturing is no longer just about making a 
product and selling it

Manufacturers are increasingly using a wider ‘value 
chain’ to generate new and additional revenue 
from pre- and post-production activities, with 
production playing a fundamental role in allowing 
these other activities to occur. Capturing value 
from manufacturing is therefore increasingly about 
capturing value throughout the lifecycle of products1. 
For example, 39% of UK manufacturers with 100 or 
more employees derived value from ‘manufacturing 
services’ related to their products in 20112. 

Manufacturing will continue evolving in the future, 
with new ways of doing business placing greater 
importance on using new sources of knowledge 
and information, and establishing much closer, 
long-term relationships with customers. Future 
sources of new and additional revenue for 
manufacturers are likely to include the following3: 

 

Selling services in combination with products 
much more extensively;

  Using products to generate new information 
about consumers and the usage of products;

  Becoming ‘factoryless goods producers’, capturing 

 

value by selling technological knowledge and 
leaving production to someone else;
Shifting to a ‘circular economy’ way of 
doing business, with end of life products 
remanufactured and returned to original 
specifications or better;

  Making use of changes in product ownership, 

by providing more robust products for 
‘collaborative consumption’ as opposed to 
outright ownership of a product;

 

Forming strategic alliances with 
manufacturers across sub-sectors, resulting 
in collaborative communities which may 
become more significant than networks 
dominated by lead firms; and

  Using operational capabilities combined with 

greater entrepreneurial insight to respond 
rapidly to technological developments. 

An integrated view of manufacturing is needed

The current metrics used to measure the 
performance of the manufacturing sector by the 
Office for National Statistics (ONS), the 2007 
Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system, 
captures data relating to the production output 
of manufacturing firms. 

New metrics are needed to assess the scale 
and location of important changes within the 
sector. These will be critical in revealing key 
interconnections in the economy, clarifying the 
important role of production in the manufacturing 
value chain, and helping to identify where in the 
value chain policy intervention should focus to 
support manufacturers as they create new and 
additional revenue streams.

2.1.1  
manufacTuring  
Today 

Manufacturing has traditionally been understood as 
the production process in which raw materials are 
transformed into physical products4, involving people 
and other resources (Figure 2.1). 

This production-focussed perspective has been 
used to make the argument that developed 
economies have entered a post-industrial age, 
with production declining in importance and 
deindustrialisation now the norm5. However, recent 
thinking considers production as a critical part of a 
much wider manufacturing ‘value chain’6 (Figure 2.2), 
which includes complementary pre-production and 
post-production activities.

This growth in complexity of the manufacturing 
value chain has, for many sub-sectors, led to 
an increased contribution to overall final value 
from pre- and post-production or fabrication 
services (Figure 2.3)13. However, production in 
the manufacturing value chain remains of central 
importance in allowing these other activities to 
occur. It is the production of a product, such as a 
Rolls-Royce engine, that ‘drives’ the value chain, 
providing the capabilities, including technological 
expertise needed to create revenue from pre- 
and post-production activities.

There is broad agreement emerging on the rapidly 
evolving nature of the manufacturing value chain, as 
emphasised in Box 2.1. A recent report by the US 
Advanced Manufacturing Partnership also referred 
to manufacturers’ ability to respond to customer 
needs7, which places manufacturing within a wider 
business context. 

Today, manufacturing embraces diverse commercial 
activities operating across integrated global supply 
chains, financial networks and trade frameworks8. 
Two particular developments have fuelled increases 
in complexity in recent decades: the growth of 
manufacturing services, and the demand for bespoke 
products requiring manufacturers to increasingly 
take a ‘make to order’ approach, tailoring products 
to meet specific needs9.

‘The application of leading-edge technical knowledge 
and expertise for the creation of products, 
production processes and associated services, which 
have strong potential to bring sustainable growth 
and high economic value to the UK. Activities may 
stretch from R&D at one end to recycling at the 
other’ (Technology Strategy Board, 2012)10.

‘The new era of manufacturing will be marked 
by highly agile, networked enterprises that use 
information and analytics as skilfully as they employ 
talent and machinery to deliver products and 
services to diverse global markets’ (McKinsey & 
Company, 2012)11.

Note: Within this value chain some elements are repeated many times, for example as components come together to build a complex product. 
There are also feedback loops which may vary for different sub-sectors.

Reuse, remanufacturing, recycling & recovery

Manufacturing firms are increasingly adjusting how 
they do business to create new and additional 
revenue streams. Servitisation, personalisation, the 
circular economy and rental models are all examples 
of current trends in the innovation of business 
models, discussed shortly. These will become 
important in most sub-sectors in future decades as 
technological, economic, environmental and social 
trends force manufacturing firms in these directions. 
For example, technological developments such 
as the integration of sensors into products, and 
advances in information communication technology 
will enable products to be increasingly ‘personalised’. 

Servitisation

Servitisation is the provision of services to clients 
by manufacturing firms15, with services typically 
supporting or complementing products and helping 
manufacturers to establish long-term relationships 
with consumers (see Figure 2.4)16. This is likely to be 
an important trend for manufacturers to embrace, 
by exploiting complementarities that can arise when 
offering both products and services.

2.1.2  
The imporTance  
of changing  
business models

Business models describe how organisations 
create, deliver and capture value. In the case of 
manufacturing firms, business models are typically 
considered in terms of the technologies involved, 
what is being sold, and the wider network 
a manufacturer is dependent upon. The UK 
manufacturing sector typically adopts a ‘linear’ 
business model, based on the production and  
sale of products14. But this is changing.

Official statistics shed little light on servitisation,  
as discussed in the following section on measuring 
manufacturing, however survey evidence reveals 
that 39% of UK manufacturing firms with over 
100 employees derived revenue from services in 
2011, compared to 24% in 200717. Other surveys 
conclude that 80% of manufacturing firms are likely 
to have derived revenue from services in 200818. In 
reality, it is more likely that almost all manufacturers 
provide some degree of services, with the extent of 
provision depending on various factors including the 
sophistication of the product, with more complex 
and expensive products likely to have a wider range 
of relevant services available. There is therefore a 
distinction to be made between ‘service enhanced’ 
and ‘service oriented’ manufacturers19. Little evidence 
is available on specific sub-sectors.

Estimates of revenues from services are limited to 
manufacturing firms which report service revenue 
separately. There is no obligation on manufacturers 
to do this. In 2009, the following manufacturers 
generated substantial proportions of revenue from 
services: Rolls Royce (49%); ST-Ericsson (38%); 
Atlas Copco Group (43%); Tyco (40%); Alstom 
(26%); Arcelor Mittal (29%)20. Specific examples 
of manufacturing services include the well known 
‘Power-by-the-Hour’ Rolls Royce offering, using 
capital equipment on an access basis. This service 
has required new process and technology to 
capture usage data. Similarly, Alstom Group is a 
multi-specialist product and service provider offering 
transport, transmission and clean power solutions as 
well as technical training for the railway sector21.

Despite growth in the numbers of firms offering 
manufacturing services, most manufacturers still 
focus on products and largely ignore services22, with 
only 15% of firms typically deriving 25% or more 
of their revenue from services23. This is especially 
the case for smaller firms and firms in ‘upstream’ 
sectors such as materials, as opposed to firms in 
‘downstream’ finished product sectors24. There is 
also evidence that small extensions into services are 
worse than none at all, with firm value only rising 
once service revenue constitutes about 30% of total 
revenue25. This emphasises the importance of not 
entering into service provision half-heartedly. Clarity 
about the different forms of manufacturing services,

to develop them is needed if this source of value 
creation is to be exploited. 

Systems and solutions, which encapsulate a range of 
services sold in support of products, were the most 
common form of services offered in 2011, followed 
by design and development, and maintenance and 
support. These services have remained dominant 
since 2007 (Figure 2.5)26. Of the countries shown in 
Figure 2.627, the US had the greatest proportion of 
manufacturing firms offering services in 2011 (56%), 
and the UK had the ninth-highest level.

Between 2007-2011, the extent of servitisation 
also rose significantly in other countries including 
Sweden, Norway and France, as well as in China, 
from 1% to almost 20%28. Evidence suggests that 
services are added to generate extra revenue 
and to ‘lock-in’ customers29, 30. They can also make 
products and their maintenance more accessible, 
enable customer-specific uses and linkage to other 
products and provide the benefits of a product 
without exchange of ownership.

2.1.3 Trends in  
fuTure business 
model innovaTion

A number of other business models are likely to become 
more common in the decades ahead, as manufacturers 
seek to create new and additional revenue streams. 
These are grouped as trends (see Table 2.1), which are 
also highlighted throughout the report. 

2.1.4 measuring 
manufacTuring

The performance of the manufacturing sector has, 
since 1948, been measured by focussing on the 
production output of manufacturing firms using a 
system of Standard Industrial Classification (SIC), 
which classifies businesses by the type of economic 
activity in which they are engaged31. Manufacturing 
classifications focus on the production process, as 
opposed to the wider manufacturing value chain. 
The latest SICs used by the Office for National 
Statistics were last revised in 2007. 

28 Neely, A. Benedetinni, O. & Visnjic, I. (2011) 29 Neely, A. (2008) 30 Cusumano, M. (2010) 31 For further details see:

2. The past, the present, and a modern lens 53

New measures of manufacturing performance  
need to rise to the increasing challenge of attributing 
to manufacturing ‘production-dependent’ goods 
and services. This would enhance understanding 
of value creation in the sector, and ensure that the 
critical role of production is not underestimated. The 
measurement of manufacturing, and implications for 
Government, is discussed more fully in Chapter 7.

As the pace of change in manufacturing accelerates, 
these metrics are increasingly likely to misrepresent 
the performance of the sector, providing limited insight 
into important and innovative connections across the 
economy, and the central role of production in the 
manufacturing value chain. This is primarily due to the 
current metrics failing to capture:

  The inter-relatedness and complexity of the 

manufacturing value chain, with various activities 
and firms dependent on the production of a 
manufactured product. In the past, these activities 
would generally have been undertaken mostly 
at one location, however they now tend to 
be separated out or fragmented into separate 
businesses classified outside of manufacturing32. 
  Activities such as the production of goods that 

would be classed to manufacturing but are 
done through service-type activities, such as 
wholesaling. For example, ‘factoryless goods 
producers’ (see Table 2.1) heavily involved 
in activities relating to the production of 
manufactured goods in the future are not 
currently likely to be classified as manufacturers. 
A study33 of the US manufacturing sector 
indicates that reclassifying factoryless goods 
producers to the manufacturing sector instead 
of the wholesale sector would have shifted at 
as many as 1,934,000 workers from wholesale 
to manufacturing sectors in 2007, and increased 
reported manufacturing output by US$895 
billion (16.8%), indicating how extensive these 
activities are.

32 Up until the early 1980s manufacturing was, relatively speaking, simpler and often located in a small number of large plants, with a greater range of 
activities classified as manufacturing including financial and HR services undertaken in the plant. Between 1984 – 1990 manufacturing underwent a period 
of outsourcing and fragmentation (Chapter 4.2), with some ‘non-core’ activities reclassified as non-manufacturing activities. This helps to partly explain why 
manufacturing accounts for a smaller share of overall GDP. See Evidence Paper 23: Moffat, J. (2013) 33 Bernard, A. & Fort,T. (2013)

Incentives shifted: as manufacturers bear 
costs of maintenance and repair, they are 
more likely to design products to reduce 
those costs. 

  Business models based on temporary or 
shared/collaborative ownership, with shifts 
from a linear to a circular economy, i.e. 
where products are re-used, ‘re-purposed’, 
repaired, re-manufactured and recycled, 
rather than being used and discarded34, 35. 

  Re-manufacturing, whereby high-value 
or high-use parts of (typically) capital 
equipment are returned, repaired and 
re-sold. Already seen in aerospace, 
commercial vehicles, passenger cars and 
medical equipment. 

  Re-manufacturing being used as a market-

entry mechanism in emerging markets, 
for example by Volvo in India, where 
re-manufactured engines are 65% of the 
price of new engines. 

  Re-manufacturing institutionalised 

through standards, with more products 
designed from the outset with re-
manufacturing in mind.

 

  New connections between products, 
individuals, institutions and information 
become possible. As this occurs, new 
sources of value are created, and new 
business models are likely. 
Increased ability to connect a physical 
artefact to information, for example through 
measuring usage and linking to the identity 
of a user, makes it feasible to operate non-
ownership-based business models. 
Information-enhanced products and the 
wider ecosystems in which they exist offer 
opportunities for additional value creation.
It will be important to understand the rights 
of those who create information, to protect 
ownership, and to safeguard the privacy of 
those to whom information relates.

  Represents a major opportunity for 

manufacturers whose capability in

manufacturers in emerging economies 
gain these capabilities. 

  These manufacturers will have to shift 

their reliance on recouping expenditure on 
R&D through selling products, to selling the 
design and development in its own right. 

  This requires a major effort in designing the  

product, and doing so in concert with the 
business models of relevant partners in the 
value chain36. 

  ARM Holdings is a good example of this 

business model trend.

  Environmental sustainability will become 
an increasingly important component of 
product differentiation and value-creation.

  Empirical evidence shows that environmental 

sustainability can reduce costs, with 
sustainable management of supply chains 
resulting in improved financial performance 
of a firm38.

  Environmental sustainability is likely to come 

to be measured and managed in order to 
provide clear information for consumers.  
This will be part of the mechanism for 
capturing value from sustainability.

‘Infinite bandwidth/zero latency’ (IBZL)41 
would potentially remove obstacles to 
working across firm boundaries and 
distances, making data-transfer-intensive 
processes requiring telepresence more 
feasible.

  An illustrative instance of this is remote 

surgery, whereby a surgeon is able to 
operate via a robot which is able to  
provide real-time sensory feedback.

  Telepresence will affect development  

and production processes of manufacturing, 
as well as create opportunities for new  
types of services.

  GPTs provide a basis for value creation,  

but the business model achieves value 
creation and value capture. Value creation 
depends on the ability to use GPTs to 
generate ‘novel applications’. This goes 
beyond finding products in which new 
technology can be inserted as a replacement.
  The most valuable future economic activity 

in biotechnology and nanotechnology is 
likely to not be in the manufacture of input 
materials, but in the application of these 
technologies.

  The ability of firms to coordinate activity 
through collaborative, inter-organisational 
connections is likely to continue to increase 
as IT makes it easier to access the capabilities 
and resources of others. 

  The ability of firms to collaborate and access 

 

others’ capabilities will become critical.
‘Co-production’ between firms is likely  
to occur as collaborative communities of 
firms emerge, which may become more 
significant than tight networks dominated  
by a few lead firms.

The areas of UK value generated by the 
manufacturing sector are diverse, and set 
out in Section 2.2. The influence of the 
manufacturing landscape extends beyond 
immediate and obvious areas, creating further 
value, not always exclusive to manufacturing, 
which include economic, intellectual, social, 
natural and human capital. These aspects of 
value were all emphasised at the Project’s 
international workshops46.

Strength in the manufacturing value chain is 
important in driving product innovation and 
success in the marketplace42 This is reflected in 
the ‘Big M’ concept of manufacturing43 which 
emphasises that many factors within the business 
and wider external environment influence the 
manufacturing value chain. The eight ‘Big M’ 
groupings listed below are supported by the 
Deloitte Global Manufacturing Competiveness 
Index 201344 and the US Advanced Manufacturing 
Partnership on Capturing Competitive Advantage 
in Advanced Manufacturing45.

Value in some other areas is less tangible. For 
example, proximity to manufacturing creates 
innovation spillovers across industries, supporting 
the next generation of products and processes47. 
Even less tangibly, manufacturing creates a sense 
of identity and civic pride48 in the workforce and 
wider population through the power of brands and 
awareness that products are ‘made in my country’, 
while products and services improve the quality of 
life of customers and users. Figure 2.7 provides an 
illustration of the how the manufacturing system 
sits within wider society and the economy. It builds 
on the ‘Big M’ concept by emphasising that the 
manufacturing value chain should be viewed in 
the context of wider business activities, external 
business environment, and elements of value. 

Figure 2.7: The manufacturing value chain, its wider 
context, and the diverse areas where it creates 
and stimulates value

2.1.6 implicaTions 
for policy maKers

Today, manufacturing is no longer just about a 
production process in which raw materials are 
transformed into a physical product. Emphasis is 
now on making use of a wider and interconnected 
manufacturing value chain, including production 
processes which remain of central importance. The 
manufacturing sector is likely to continue evolving, 
with value created in increasingly diverse ways. 
Changes in business models and other areas will 
result in a more interconnected manufacturing 
system, with production at its heart.

2. The past, the present, and a modern lens 59

Given the wider manufacturing system which 
is emerging, new metrics are needed to assess 
the scale and location of changes within the 
sector. These will be critical in revealing key 
interconnections in the economy; understanding the  
significant role of production in the manufacturing 
value chain; and helping to identify where in the

to support manufacturers (see Chapter 7) as they

2.2 The value of 
manufacTuring in 
The uK economy – 
pasT and presenT

Key messages 
In assessing the role of manufacturing, it 
is important to go beyond its direct share 
of output and employment. Manufacturing 
continues to be highly interconnected to other 
sectors, making it important to future economic 
growth, exports and high value jobs. The value of 
manufacturing to the economy is set out in this 
section through discussion of: 

  Productivity: Manufacturing plays a powerful 

role in driving economic productivity. 
Between 1980 and 2009, UK total factor 
productivity (TFP) growth was an average 
of 0.7% per annum, with manufacturing 
growth an average of 2.3%. 

  Exports: Manufacturing businesses are 

more likely to engage in exporting, with 
60% of manufacturing businesses with ten 
or more employees exporting products 
and services in 2010 compared to 26% of 
non-manufacturers. UK exports of goods 
produced by the manufacturing sector 
totalled £256 billion in 2012, accounting for 
around 53% of all UK exports49.

  Research and Development (R&D): 

Manufacturing businesses are more likely 
to undertake R&D. 40.7% of manufacturing 
businesses with ten or more employees 

allocated resources to R&D in 2010 compared 
to an average of 23.4% of businesses in other 
sectors. Manufacturers also accounted for 
72-79% of total UK expenditure on R&D 
throughout 2000-2011. 
Innovation: Manufacturers are more likely to 
innovate, with 26% of manufacturing businesses 
with ten or more employees undertaking 
process innovation (less than 14% for 
non-manufacturers) and 44% undertaking 
product innovation (less than 26% for non-
manufacturers) in 2010. 
Inter-industry linkages: Manufacturing 
‘dominates’ other industries through the 
strength of its linkages to other industries 
when inputs and outputs are measured. 
Scales of production: Manufacturing plants 
have experienced significant returns to scale 
of production over 1997-2006 which will be 
important in raising productivity and driving 
economic growth in the future. 

 

 

 

  Highly skilled jobs: In 2011, employee 

remuneration in manufacturing was some 
10% higher when compared to the average 
for comparable occupations across all 
industries, reflecting the high levels of skills 
required in modern manufacturing roles.

Overall, manufacturing performs well above what 
might be expected given its relative contribution 
to areas crucial to long-run economic growth. To 
this extent, it has high levels of additionality in the 
economy. This evidence, when combined with the 
wider view of the manufacturing sector described 
in Section 2.1, makes the case for the critical 
importance of manufacturing to the UK economy 
today and in the future50.   

This Section reviews recent data to establish a 
baseline of manufacturing’s changing contribution 
to the UK economy, and its performance compared 
with international competitors. As the current 
Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) metrics 
relating to manufacturing are somewhat narrow in 
scope51, as discussed in the previous section, the 
available data paint a limited picture but provide 
important insights.

49 ONS (2012a) – the denominator to get the percentage is available from the total exports of goods and services found in: ONS (2012b). 50 Davis, E. 
(2011) 51 The SIC is based on the main good(s) and/or service(s) supplied by a plant or firm. Thus, it does not take account of linkages across the value 
chain, and how plants/firms combine different elements from this chain when producing manufacturing value-added.

2.2.1 producTiviTy – 
manufacTuring as 
an engine for  
creaTing wealTh 
and income

Productivity, and especially the productivity of 
both labour and capital inputs into the production 
process, i.e. total factor productivity (TFP) is widely 
recognised as a key driver of long-run economic 
growth. As Paul Krugman52 noted ‘…Productivity 
isn’t everything, but in the long run it is almost 
everything’. William Baumol similarly states that, 
‘without exaggeration, in the long run probably 
nothing is as important for economic welfare as the 
rate of productivity growth’53. 

TFP is typically defined as the increase in output 
that is not due to an increase in the direct inputs 

used to produce goods and services54 (i.e. more 
efficient use of labour and physical capital and/
or the development of new products). Country 
and industry studies confirm the importance of 
TFP and its dominance in explaining differences in 
output growth across economies55. 

This emphasis on productivity is linked with the 
concept of self-reliant economic growth, which 
stresses the importance of growing industries 
or sectors that are likely to be self-reliant. A self-
sufficient industry56 is not dependent upon local 
demand alone, has a high ability to innovate, is highly 
interconnected to other industries, and encourages 
wider growth by its expansion.

Growth in UK total factor productivity for 
1980-2009 was 0.7% per annum. TFP growth in 
manufacturing was three times higher at 2.3% p.a. 
over the same period (see Table 2.2)57. Of the top 
10 performing sectors, manufacturing industries 
account for eight (telecommunications, and

agriculture, fishing and forestry are the  
others). Although manufacturing contributed  
higher levels of TFP growth, its relatively small(er) 
share of the economy means that the lower 
performance of other sectors dominate total  
UK productivity growth58. When TFP is compared 
across the UK and five EU member states between 
1980-2009 (see Figure 2.8)59, manufacturing 
performs best, in comparison to other sectors,  
only in the UK. In the five other countries, 
agriculture, fishing and forestry had the highest 
TFP growth in this period. Nevertheless, in every 
country, manufacturing is above the industry  
average and every sub-period covered.  

2.2.2 exporTs

Manufacturing is critical for the exporting of 
goods and services. As world demand for exports 
grows alongside globalisation, exporting produces 
additional income for the UK economy. UK exports 
of goods produced by the manufacturing sector 
totalled £256 billion in 2012, accounting for around 
53% of all UK exports60.

On the supply side, exporting is recognised as 
leading to higher productivity61. This is because 
businesses that export typically have to become 

58 According to the EUKLEMS database, which is used here, in 1980 manufacturing accounted for 24.3% of total UK value-added; by 2010 it accounted 
for 10.0%. 59 Evidence Paper 14: Hay, G. et al. (2013) 60 ONS (2012a) – the denominator to get the percentage is available from the total exports of 
goods and services found in: ONS (2012b). 61 Salomon, R. and Shaver, J. (2005)

more productive to break down ‘barriers-to-
exporting’ which are mostly linked to higher levels 
of competition in international markets. Firms that 
operate in more competitive export markets have 
access to and knowledge of better technologies 
and/or higher quality products. They can obtain an 
additional current and future productivity benefit if 
they can utilise this. Direct information on technical 
and product development is often provided by 
customers and suppliers which can stimulate a firm’s 
own innovation outputs62 63.

Share of exports/
imports relative to 
non-manufacturing share

Manufacturing accounts for an even larger share 
of imports relative to its size, which explains why 
manufacturing net exports have been negative in 
recent years. Also, this negative contribution to the 
balance of trade has been increasing. Negative net 
exports suggest two interrelated factors are at play. 
First, UK exports have been losing their share of 
world exports through a lack of competitiveness. 
Secondly, fragmentation of manufacturing 
production since the mid-1980s through the spatial 
fragmentation of production has led to outsourcing 
of intermediate goods and services to overseas 
locations with attractive production costs68.  
Firms in manufacturing are also much more likely to 
engage in exporting. In 2010, 60% of manufacturing 
firms were engaged in exporting while in non-
manufacturing the figure was only 26%69 (Table 2.3)70.

Some argue that economic growth is determined 
by the growth of exports, with non-export sector 
growth depending upon the export base. With 
the manufacturing sector as the major source of 
exports, growth of national output is dependent 
upon growth of the manufacturing sector. Certainly, 
manufacturing products (Figure 2.9)64 are the largest 
contributor to exports relative to the sector’s share 
of total industry value-added. The manufacturing 
share of total final demand65 is more than twice the 
average of all other industries66, although this has 
fallen from 3.1 to 2.2 between 1997 and 201067.

62 Aw, B., Roberts, M. & Xu, D. (2011) 63 Greenaway, D. & Kneller, R. (2007) 64 ONS (2011) 65 Total final demand in the economy equals the sum of 
spending on consumption (UK household and government sectors), fixed investment (by UK business and government sectors), stockbuilding (a small 
component of final demand), and exports (spending by overseas purchasers on UK goods & services). 66The relative shares in Figure 2 are computed 
as (exports÷total final demand)m÷ (exports÷total final demand)nm, where m = manufacturing and nm= rest of the economy. 67 The top 20 product 
subgroups (out of a total of 110 subgroups identified in the UK supply-and-use tables) for exports in 2010 accounted for 67.8% of UK exports of 
goods and services. Of these 8 were non-manufacturing, providing 27.5% of total UK exports (there were: Financial intermediation – 6.0%; office & 
business support services – 4.8%; auxiliary support to financial services – 4.3%; oil and gas extraction – 4.1%; insurance & pension services – 3.0%; other 
professional & technical services – 2.0%; water transport services – 2.0%; and scientific R&D services – 1.4%). 68 Baldwin, R. (2006) 69 Data based on 
2004, 2006 and 2008 (comparable to Table 2.3) produces very similar results. 70 Harris, R. & Moffat, J. (2013a)

UK businesses between 2000 & 2011

Spending on R&D has an impact on Total Factor 
Productivity (TFP) in two ways. Most obviously, 
R&D may generate process innovations which 
allow existing products to be produced with 
greater efficiency, through lower costs. It may also 
generate product innovations, which will improve 
TFP if the new products are produced with greater 
efficiency or by use of better technology than 
existing products71. The second way is through the 
development of ‘absorptive capacity’72 73, which 
relates to a firm’s ability to recognise the value of 
new internal and external information, absorb it, 
and exploit it74 to compete and grow in markets.

Manufacturers are also more likely to undertake 
R&D than firms in other sectors (see Table 
2.3). In 2010, some 40.7% of manufacturers 
allocated resources to R&D while on average 
only 23.4% in other sectors did so. Nearly one 
third of manufacturers neither undertook R&D or 
exporting, compared to nearly two thirds of non-
manufacturers. The comparison is starker when 
the percentages that undertook both activities are 
compared: over 31% of manufacturers exported 
and undertook R&D (BERD) while less than 
10% in non-manufacturing did both. Figures from 
the business enterprise R&D survey show that 
throughout 2000-2011, relatively constant (real) 
spending on R&D in manufacturing75 amounted 
to 72-79% of total UK R&D expenditure (see 
Figure 2.10)76, with much of the remainder being 
attributable to telecoms, computer services and 
R&D services77.

R&D is one source of intangible assets which 
improve productivity, for example through 
innovations and/or greater efficiency. Figure 2.1178, 79, 
80 shows the incidence of spending on these assets 
is generally higher in manufacturing (investing in 
software is the exception) with manufacturing firms 
also tending to spend more on average.

71 Innovation is defined here in using the traditional approach (i.e., product and process innovations). Note, we do make use of a much wider concept 
(‘absorptive capacity’) (see Harris, R. and Li, Q.C. (2009) 72 Cohen, W. and Levinthal, D. (1989) 73 Zahra, S. A. & George, G. (2002) 74 Zahra, S. A. & 
George, G. (2002) Note, absorptive capacity was developed by Cohen and Levinthal (1989) 75 In 2011 prices, spending in manufacturing was between 
£11.7b to £12.7b throughout this period. 76 ONS (2012d) 77 Evidence paper 14 Hay G. et. al. (2013, Table 15) shows that manufacturing dominates 
total business R&D spending in France, Germany, Japan and the U.S. during 1997-2007. 78 The diagram shows the average spend per firm by sector (note 
manufacturing comprises the overwhelming majority of the production sector data produced here) for those undertaking spending, while the figures 
along the top of the diagram indicate the percentages of firms that undertook each activity. 79 Awano, G., Franklin, M. Haskel, J., & Kastrinaki, Z. (2010)

UK-owned manufacturing firms involved in exporting 
tend to have higher absorptive capacity than those 
not involved in exporting (Figure 2.12)81, with foreign-
owned subsidiaries engaged in exporting having the 
highest levels of absorptive capacity.

The UK manufacturing sector demonstrates a 
stronger rate of product and process innovation 
(44% for 2010) than non-manufacturing sectors 
(26%) (see Figure 2.13)82. Product innovation 
was particularly strong in the development 
of medical and other precision instruments, 
electrical machinery, chemicals, and rubber & 
plastics, but strong too in computing and R&D 
services. Over 26% of manufacturers in 2010 
undertook process innovation compared to 
under 14% of non-manufacturers.

2.2.4 inTer- 
indusTry linKages

For an industry to make a major contribution to 
long-run growth, it should have strong purchases 
and sales known as input-output (demand and 
supply) linkages with other industries that it 
dominates, and therefore have a high capacity 
for transmitting growth83. To determine which 
industries ‘dominate’ others requires examination 
of the strength of such ’forward’ and ‘backwards’ 
inter-industry linkages84. Using the UK input-output 
tables for 2005, the latest data available, the linkage 
indices given in Table 2.485 show that manufacturing 
and transport and communication are the most 
propulsive industries, as they are the only sectors 
with both linkages at or above one. 

81 Harris, R. and Li, Q.C. (2009) Note: We use a single overall AC index here, which by construction has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 across 
establishments who provide the data used to measure AC. 82 Figure based on calculations by Lead Expert Group using CIS 2011 data. 83 Lasuen, (1971) 
84 Backward linkages, denoting purchases of intermediate inputs from suppliers, show the impact on other industries when the demand for industry j rises 
by one unit; i.e., the addition output resulting through j’s purchases of intermediate inputs from other interlinked industries. Forward linkages, denoting sales 
of intermediate inputs to customers, shows the output generated in industry i when (final) demand in each interconnect industry j is increased by one unit; 
i.e., the additional intermediate sales made by industry i to meet the extra demand from other interlinked industries. Key industries are defined as those for 
which both indices are greater than one, since these industries dominate through their forward and backward linkages. 85 ONS (2011)

2.2.5 scales of  
producTion

Increasing returns to scale86, i.e. output more than 
doubles when capital and labour inputs are doubled, 
result from internal, external and agglomeration 
economies87. Evidence shows that increasing returns 
to scale enable some firms to produce more 
cheaply by concentrating production in a smaller 
number of potentially geographically co-located 
plants88. Increasing returns will lead to greater 
productivity, and economic growth. Evidence for 
the UK, based on data for 1997-200689, shows 
that manufacturing plants generally experience 
greater increasing returns to scale, while in non-
manufacturing constant or decreasing returns are 
more common. 

2.2.6 highly sKilled 
jobs

Some argue that manufacturing is over-dependent 
on manual skill occupations which pay lower wages. 
Manufacturing has relatively more employees 
in process, plant and machine operatives, skilled 
trades, and managers & senior officials. It has fewer 
in all other occupational groups (Figure 2.14)90. 
Over time, the sector has increased its reliance on 
managers & senior officials, professional, associate 
professionals & technical occupations, and decreased 
its reliance on manual ‘shop-floor’ occupations.

Employee remuneration was some 10% higher in 
manufacturing than the average across all industries 
in 2011 (see Figure 2.15)91. Those working in 
manufacturing were generally paid more than in 
comparable occupations across all sectors. 

86 The importance of returns to scale in ‘cumulative causation’ models is explained in: Kaldor, N. (1985); Krugman, P. (1991); and Krugman, P. (1980). 
87 Harris, R. & Moffat, J. (2011) 88 Baldwin, R., Forslid, R., Martin R., Ottaviano, G.I. & Robert-Nicoud, F. (2003) 89 Awano, G., Franklin, M., Haskel, J. &

If pay is an indication of skill levels linked to the 
productivity of human capital, then the data suggests 
that manufacturing performs significantly better than 
the average across all industries. Further evidence 
relating to the role of people in manufacturing is 
provided in Chapter 6.

3. Faster, more 
responsive  
and closer  
to customers

Technology will play a central role in driving change 
in manufacturing. Some of the value being created 
in 2050 will derive from wholly unanticipated 
breakthroughs, but many of the technologies  
that will transform manufacturing, such as  
additive manufacturing, are already established  
or clearly emerging.

This Chapter examines important long-term changes 
expected in technology and innovation, and the shape 
of the potential factories of the future, setting out 
fundamental shifts in how products are designed,  
made, offered and ultimately used by consumers.

The Chapter concludes by outlining a range of 
implications for Government, and relevant advice 
where needed, that will need to be addressed as 
manufacturing becomes faster, more responsive  
and closer to customers.

3.1 technology  
and innovation

Key messages
Technology plays a central role in the 
competitiveness of UK manufacturing, supporting 
innovation, driving product development 
and providing impetus for improvements 
in manufacturing performance. The UK has 
attributes that if suitably focused, could better 
exploit maturing technologies to capture a larger 
proportion of future global markets. 

Primary or underpinning technologies such as 
information and communications technology 
(ICT), sensors, advanced and functional materials, 
biotechnology and sustainable or green 
technologies are likely to become increasingly 
pervasive in products and processes. 

Secondary or contingent technologies such as 
mobile internet, big data, the internet of things, 
robotics, additive manufacturing and cloud 
computing will make use of these underpinning 
technologies to collectively facilitate:

  Mass personalisation of low-cost products,  

on demand;

  A much more distributed local and global 
production base, with manufacturing done 
much closer to the customer and a greater 
diversity in the factories of the future  
(see Section 3.2);
‘Digitised’1 manufacturing value chains, with 
digital connections between customers, 
manufacturers and suppliers increasing the speed 
and efficiency of manufacturing, and enhancing 
opportunities for international collaboration; 

 

  Greater freedom of design;
  Delivery of innovative new products;
  Higher performance and more flexible 

manufacturing systems delivering better quality 
and cost performance; and

  Better customisation of products and services 

(called ‘customerisation’).

The pace of technological change means that 
it is not always possible to exactly predict the 
consequences of developments, or when they  
will occur. However, technological developments 
will ultimately lead to new ways of doing business, 
for example using new sources of data to make 
products more tailored or personalised, or  
to sell complementary services. It will also  
bring new challenges in the protection of 
intellectual property, skills requirements and  
cyber- and biosecurity. 

The secondary or underpinning technologies 
discussed in this section are relevant to the 
‘eight great technologies’ (big data, space, 
robotics and autonomous systems, synthetic 
biology, regenerative medicine, agri-science, 
advanced materials and energy) receiving current 
Government investment2.

3.1.1 introduction

Modern manufacturing technologies, including 
automation and robotics, and practices such as ‘lean’ 
which focus on removing non-value-adding activities3, 
are now used throughout the world following progress 
in communication and transport technologies, and the 
globalisation of supply chains. The UK’s competitiveness 
in low-, mid- and high-end technologies4 is increasingly 
being put to the test by manufacturers in emerging 
economies, which are building, or have already built, 
national research and development (R&D) bases 
and state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities. This is 
likely, eventually, to level, or even invert, differences in 
technological development between different regions 
of the world. 

In these evolving conditions, those who innovate 
most effectively will succeed in capturing and 
dominating global markets. This will include creating 
products using low energy and low resource input; 
responding to customer needs for high quality, 
customisation and personalisation; decreasing 
time to market and product delivery time; and 
maximising complementary services. Significant 
competitive advantage can achieved by establishing

high performing and technologically advanced

integrated approach to design, R&D and knowledge. 

This Section examines likely future developments 
in two areas, and considers their likely impacts and 
consequences for UK manufacturing in the decades 
ahead (Figure 3.1):

The importance of securing competitive advantage 
through key technologies has been emphasised by 
a recent study5 which estimated that the potential 
global economic impact of twelve key technologies, 
including advanced robotics and energy storage, 
could reach US$14-33 trillion by 2025. This figure 
relates to new revenue that companies will generate 
and the value individuals will personally derive from 
an innovation they do not need to pay for.

  Primary or underpinning technologies: These 

fundamental underpinning capabilities are 
pervasive and often integrated within higher level 
systems with the potential to influence almost 
every aspect of human life, wellbeing, leisure, 
business and the global economy. 
Secondary or contingent technologies: These make 
use of underpinning or basic technologies to create 
secondary technologies with higher functionality, 
from very broad and highly configurable ‘systems’, 
through to narrow and deep, highly targeted, high 
performance capabilities.

The future of manufacturing: A new era of opportunity and challenge for the UK72

Developments in these technologies are likely to be 
either derivative (including advances in technologies 
already in place); novel (immediately offering new 
capabilities, for example medical biotechnology and 
additive manufacturing); or disruptive (currently 
unknown and highly innovative technologies that 
offer unpredictable implications, with the potential 
to revolutionise an industry)6. 

3.1.2  
primary or  
underpinning 
technologies

Information and communications technology

ICT stresses the role of integrated 
telecommunications and computers, and enables 
users to access, store, transmit, and manipulate 
information. Few aspects of modern life are 
untouched by ICT following its 5-7% annual growth 
since its origins in the 1960s7. The total worldwide 
investment in ICT has been estimated as US$3.5 
trillion, and is currently doubling every 15 years8. 
Manufacturing is no exception, with investments in 
automation alone expected to comprise some 8% 
of global ICT expenditure by 20206. 

Used initially to automate human processes, ICT  
is now applied to enable integration of data across 
functions including the management of customer 
relationships, process control, product verification, 
manufacturing simulation, logistics, product traceability 
and safety systems. More recently, the capacity  
for storage (estimated at 295 billion gigabytes  
in 20079 but now significantly larger10) and global inter-
connectivity has led to the development of ‘big data’11 
‘cloud computing’12 and the ‘Internet of Things’13. 

Over the next 20 years, modelling and simulation 
is expected to become integrated into all design 
processes as the cost of computing continues 
to fall and specialised tools for virtual reality are 

developed. This will allow increasingly complex 
simulations to optimise and check the safety of 
new products, designs and production systems, 
new process concepts, factory design, and 
supply chains14. In addition, simulation capabilities 
will become embedded within processes to 
provide intelligent, adaptive, real time control, 
revolutionising quality performance and options for 
product complexity. Firms will need to adapt their 
underlying systems architectures and processes 
to cope with large amounts of data, incorporating 
new data streams such as smart sensor or social 
media feeds if they are to take advantage of new 
business opportunities15. Furthermore, the so-
called ‘knowledge economy’ and the more recent 
‘innovation economy’ are both dependent on 
the inexorable rise of the world-wide web and 
associated ICT technologies where systemised 
knowledge becomes a critical commodity.

Advanced and functional materials

Materials are integral to every manufactured 
product in the global economy, and in many 
applications, a specific property or properties  
of a material will provide competitive advantage16. 
However, new materials rarely have intrinsic 
value in themselves. They provide value through 
integration into new systems or components to 
enable improved performance or new designs. 
It is therefore difficult to disentangle materials 
development from manufacturing innovations,  
which drive each other in a spiral of improvement17. 

It is usually the case that new materials create new 
production challenges, requiring major advances 
in manufacturing process technologies that in turn 
can be used for other applications. The added value 
of materials will expand as new materials such as 
graphene, carbon nanotubes, diamond-like carbon, 
composites (ceramic, metallic and organic) with 
shape memory and self-healing properties, and 
copolymers are used more widely in applications 
including energy storage, computer and smart 
phone displays, enhanced chemicals and catalysts, 
consumer electronics, pharmaceuticals, aerospace, 
and many other types of manufacturing.

3. Faster, more responsive and closer to customers73

In the past, the key driver for new materials has 
been to achieve superior performance at high 
cost for the most elite applications, with some 
developments focused on low-cost applications. 
While this is expected to continue, other drivers, 
including global resource scarcity and environmental 
concerns18 will promote the use of sustainable 
materials and processes. For example, renewable 
inputs in the chemical industry are increasingly being 
used globally, with significant research programmes 
dedicated to the transition from petrochemicals 
to biomass19. Scarce materials, or those subject 
to fluctuations in supply, for example rare earth 
elements used in renewable energy technologies20, 
consumer electronics and aerospace, are also being 
substituted with alternative materials, reflecting 
growing realisation of the limits to non-renewable 
primary mineral resources21. 

A number of new materials, in which the UK has 
strong capabilities, are currently in development and 
are expected to penetrate the mass market in the 
near future. These include:

  Highly reactive nanoparticles, which have 

 

potential for a wide range of applications and 
could lead to manufacture at nanoscale, or 
‘atomically precise manufacturing’22. 
Lightweight materials including composites23, 
which combine ceramic, metallic and organic 
materials with design optimisation to reduce 
inputs. Also, research into multifunctional 
materials, where combinations of properties 
are used to achieve two or more functions24. 
The maturation of additive technologies will 
significantly expand the ability to create hybrid, 
tailored and graded structures, further enhancing 
the use of capabilities for design optimisation. 
  Biomaterials, or substances which interact with 

 

biological systems (discussed in a following section), 
will continue to penetrate the consumer goods sector.
Intelligent materials which have been designed 
to provide feedback into a larger system, for 
example feedback via chemical signals, with 
feedback dependent on material composition.

Sensors

Sensors are miniaturised devices which measure  
a physical, chemical or biological variable and 
convert it, usually into an electronic signal. In 
modern products and production processes, sensors 
are usually an integrated and vital part of the system, 
providing information about variables such as 
position, temperature, stress, chemical environment, 
product concentration, and number of uses. The 
global market for sensors was estimated to be 
about US$56 billion in 201025.

Sensors are ubiquitous across the manufacturing 
sector and provide data about the progress, quality 
or condition of manufacturing systems. Modern cars 
have sensors to measure the performance of vital 
components in real-time, for example tyre pressure, 
oil temperature and fuel injection. Aircraft would 
be unable to operate without sensors providing 
real-time feedback on all aspects of the airframe 
and engine status even from the most inhospitable 
environments within the hot areas of the gas turbine 
engine. Future development of nano-electro-
mechanical systems is likely to support sensing 
and control of very small systems, for example in 
consumer electronics.

The digital integration of sensors has developed 
alongside computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM) 
to allow automated real-time control of production 
processes. Internet connectivity allows the sensing 
and controlling of products in the field. For example, 
Rockwell Automation, a US business with several 
sites in the UK, manages the availability of machine 
tools remotely across client factories using real 
time data, improving the availability of equipment. 
Olympus Automation, a UK based business, is also  
a notable example of a business specialising in 
process and automation technologies for the food 
and drink, and pharmaceutical sectors. 

Developments in sensing technology performance 
will continue. But it is the integration of sensors 
into networks of technology that is expected 
to revolutionise manufacturing, especially when 
coupled to simulation and adaptive capabilities, 
providing increasing levels of process autonomy. 
New applications, for example where products

are connected to the internet, will become 
commonplace. Likely developments include 
autonomous vehicle navigation in city centres, more 
widespread use of data in new business models 
as firms seek to create new revenue streams by 
complementing their products with services, and 
remote management of automated equipment. 

As sensing infrastructure becomes more 
commonplace and confidence grows in its reliability, 
applications such as medical monitoring for the 
elderly also become viable. In the manufacturing 
sector, information will be increasingly machine-
generated, leading to self-checking inventories, 
smart containers that detect and monitor the 
status of their contents, automatic reconfiguring 
of production lines to alter a product mix, and 
condition monitoring where machines are able  
to self-diagnose and predict faults before failure26. 

Sensors will become very important for the 
future competitiveness of UK manufacturing over 
the medium and long-term27. They will be critical 
for developing competitive products and for 
achieving continued improvements in manufacturing 
performance which lead to competitive advantage 
in cost, quality and delivery. However, sensors 
rely on networks to transmit the data and on 
computing ability to store, analyse and use it 
intelligently. Manufacturers must develop their ability 
to transform this explosion of data into useful 
knowledge and value. 

Biotechnology

Biotechnology28 is used to describe any technology 
that exploits or enhances biological products.  
The global market for biotechnology products  
was valued at US$216.5 billion in 2011 and is 
expected to reach $414.5 billion in 201729. This 
section highlights key future developments in 
biotechnology, focusing on where the UK has 
competitive advantage and capability:

 

Industrial biotechnology is already exploited 
in plant and animal breeding, food ingredients, 
bulk chemicals, energy generation and materials. 
Products include genetically modified plants, 
biopharmaceuticals, biofuels, bio-based bulk,  

fine and speciality chemicals, and bioplastics (see 
Box 3.1). Biopharmaceuticals have dominated the 
sector, but food biotechnology is an emerging 
area where microorganisms and microalgae 
are being used to synthesise a range of food 
supplements. In addition, traditional production 
of leather and meat is already starting to be 
supplemented with engineered products, 
however on a small scale at present. The barriers 
restricting the development of biotechnology 
products are cost, complexity of scale-up, 
consumer acceptance and regulatory hurdles30. 

Box 3.1: new Biotechnology products
 

Sorona, an ‘eco-fibre for carpet, apparel and 
automotive’ developed by DuPont is a bio-
derived brand of poly-trimethylene terephthalate 
obtained by fermentation from corn-derived 
glucose and is expected to be the first billion-
dollar product made through industrial 
biotechnology which is not a pharmaceutical. 
  Bioplastics derived from renewable biomass 
sources, for example vegetable fats and oils, 
offer the advantages of novel functional 
properties and relatively low greenhouse gas 
emissions during manufacture31. 

 

Synthetic biology offers the capability to ‘rewire’ 
biological systems and capitalises on advances 
in DNA synthesis. Rapid progress is being 
made globally on engineering organisms at the 
level of the genome by introducing targeted 
modifications, multi-site genome engineering 
or by synthesis of whole genomes32. These 
approaches are being applied to the industrial 
production of amino acids and polyketides and 
are expected to be applied to the manufacture 
of bio-fuels.

  The regenerative medicine market33, which 
includes tissue engineering, biomaterials and 
biomolecules (scaffolds, growth factors) and 
stem cell therapies, exceeded US$3 billion in 
2010 and is expected to reach $4.5 billion by 
2014 and over $35 billion by 2019. This rapidly 
expanding market will include products such 
as tissue-engineered skin, cartilage and bone.

in vivo physiology and which could lay the 
groundwork for personalised organ fabrication34, 
point-of-care diagnostics and bedside 
manufacturing of drugs in the hospital ward  
may become possible.

  Chemical synthesis from waste streams by  

mixed microbial communities (microbiomes)  
is being extended beyond anaerobic digestion  
in the UK to produce chemicals from waste 
organic material or CO2. Traditional chemical 
markets are increasingly using products 
derived from bioprocesses or hybrid chemical-
biocatalytic reactions35. 

Over the next two decades, the range of 
biotechnology products is set to expand, with 
revenues expected to grow to US $600 billion 
by 202036. There will be a widespread adoption 
of ‘omics’, or the increased use of various fields 
of biology, by industry. The longer term promise 
is that if the interactions between molecules, 
macromolecules and cells are more fully 
understood, it will be possible to better interpret, 
predict, control and redirect complex cell systems. 
This would become an important platform for 
future UK competitive advantage, building on 
existing competencies. For example, biological 
data will provide new insights into the molecular 
mechanisms of complex diseases, allowing 
the identification of novel treatments, and the 
development of novel factories for the sustainable 
production of fuels, chemicals and materials37. 

Medical and industrial biotechnology holds 
significant potential for UK manufacturing in the 
short, medium and long term, given the UK’s 
strengths in these fields, particularly in research 
and development38. Maintaining national capability 
in critical underpinning technologies and avoiding 
over-reliance on the selection of single applications 
will however be crucial39 if the UK is to compete in 
what are expected to be substantial global markets. 

Sustainable or green technologies

Sustainable technology comprises technologies that 
reduce material or energy use to levels considered 
sustainable in the longer term. It encompasses 
a broad range of technologies from those that 
provide clean energy to everyday products with 
improved environmental performance, for example 
paint booths which use less water for cleaning. The 
importance of shifting to sustainable manufacturing 
was strongly emphasised at the three international 
workshops undertaken by the Project40. 

Future production processes are likely to compete 
on minimising energy and use of non-renewable 
materials, whilst simultaneously shifting to renewable 
sources as they become available and economically 
viable41, 42, 43, 44. This shift will benefit manufacturing 
activities, as businesses become more resilient 
to shocks on the supply and price of energy and 
materials. Firms will increasingly favour resilient 
supply chains, with built-in redundancy which allows 
adaptation to disturbances with minimal financial 
impact45, despite higher transaction costs and 
reduced efficiency46. More resilient supply chains 
are likely to be shorter with fewer links, and include 
more local suppliers with shorter transport routes. 
Firms will embrace the benefits of co-location in 
‘industrial ecology’47 systems, taking advantage of 
reduced reliance on raw materials by using ‘circular 
economy’ waste cycles as end-of-life products are 
re-used48 (see Chapter 5 for details). 

All sub-sectors will need to adapt to embrace 
sustainable technologies if they are to remain 
competitive. For example, in the UK chemical sector, 
research and engineering practices are likely to 
change fundamentally, as ‘green chemistry’49, 50, where 
products and processes are designed to minimise 
the use and generation of hazardous substances, 
becomes widely adopted. Similarly, in industrial 
biotechnology, biological catalysts are increasingly 
likely to replace chemical catalysts.

The future of manufacturing: A new era of opportunity and challenge for the UK76

The UK is currently considered an average 
performer in the development of clean technology 
in support of sustainable manufacturing51, with 
significant barriers including a lack of support for 
R&D activities52. However in the future, achieving 
sustainability presents major opportunities for the 
UK manufacturing sector53, with significant potential 
economic, social and environmental benefits’54.  
For example, the world market for energy 
efficiency-related products has been estimated to  
be US $1.2 trillion by 2020, which the UK could 
exploit using its existing competitive advantage 
in some areas of low-carbon technology55. As the 
UK is competing directly with other countries 
who are also targeting the rapidly growing market 
for sustainable technology, policies will need to 
encourage innovation (for example, with higher 
landfill taxes) without stifling growth by making  
UK firms uncompetitive or unattractive to foreign 
direct investment.

3.1.3 secondary 
technological  
developments

Secondary technologies make use of underpinning 
or basic technologies to bolster secondary or 
contingent technological developments. For 
example, the ‘Internet of Things’ could not evolve 
without sensors, which themselves are dependent 
on the development of new materials, ICT and 
techniques for data analysis.

Mobile internet56, 57

The influence of the mobile internet extends 
far beyond the provision of access to a browser 
from smartphones, tablets or laptops, and has 
the potential to bring significant opportunities to 
the manufacturing sector. It encompasses a range 
of functions relating to service delivery, worker 
productivity, remote and mobile healthcare, 
personalisation, and directed advertising. 

The use of built-in GPS and the possibilities of 
adding radio frequency identification (RFID), 
near-field communication (NFC), bar code, quick 
response (QR) code and magnetic stripe capabilities, 
will mean that smartphones are positioned to 
become ubiquitous, general purpose tools for the 
management of supply chains, assets, maintenance, 
and production. 

Technologies whose future is inextricably 
linked with mobile internet include battery 
technology, advanced and low energy displays, 
new user interface designs, nano-miniaturisation 
of electronics and optoelectronics, plastic 
electronics, wireless techniques and sophisticated 
encryption technologies.

Knowledge-based automation and big data58

An integration of artificial intelligence (AI), natural 
user interfaces (NUI), more intuitive computing 
and new techniques for the analysis of large data 
sets (big data) will allow continued automation 
of many tasks that formerly required people. The 
amount of data collected and stored worldwide59 
is already increasing at a rapid rate, and its analysis 
will become a key aspect of competitiveness, 
underpinning new cycles of growth in productivity 
and innovation. The expanding volume and detail of 
information captured by businesses and the rise of 
multimedia, social media and the ‘Internet of Things’ 
will fuel a continued massive increase in data in the 
decades ahead60. 

Big data can create significant value by making 
information much more accessible, transparent  
and usable at much higher frequency. The collection 
of more accurate and detailed data can expose 
variability in customer preferences and the usage 
of products, and be used to boost product 
performance and personalise products or services. 
It can also improve decision making through 
sophisticated analytical algorithms and assist in 
the design and development of next generation 
products, manufacturing processes and services. 
There is clearly an opportunity here for UK 
manufacturers to rise to the challenge of making 
better use of data in the future. For example, in the 
US estimates indicate that if the healthcare sector

were to utilise big data to drive efficiency and quality, 
it would create more than US$300 billion in value 
annually and reduce overall expenditure by about 
8%61. However, several issues concerning privacy, 
security, intellectual property, and skills shortages will 
have to be addressed if the full potential of big data 
is to be realised. 

The ‘Internet of Things’62, 63

Physical, chemical and biological sensors embedded 
in devices, equipment, clothing, machinery and 
people, and linked via wireless and near-field 
communications, are likely to be able to ‘talk 
to’ intranets and the rest of the internet within 
the next couple of decades. There will be major 
impacts for UK manufacturers in the optimisation 
of business processes, and management of natural 
resources, energy delivery and minimisation, and 
remote and mobile healthcare. In the factory and 
process control environment, virtually everything is 
expected to be connected via central networks and 
the Internet. Industrial products will become more 
autonomous in functionality, with systems which may 
incorporate millions of sensors. 

Within the next few decades, software that 
oversees how, when and where devices embedded 
with sensors function will be critical. These 
developments, when combined with smartphones, 
will allow a multitude of tasks on the factory 
floor to be improved, including the control and 
programming of robotic and automation systems, 
and troubleshooting of quality issues. It may also be 
possible to combine touch, and gesture or motion 
with voice interfaces to direct artificial intelligence 
(AI) assistants, which have access to search engines, 
databases and cloud computing systems. 

Cloud computing64

Cloud technology can provide centralised 
computing facilities to serve company intranets, 
suppliers or service providers. In the future, more 
efficient and effective use of computing and 
software resources may enable manufacturers 
to access resources more economically than by 
building their own systems and architectures. Cloud 
storage and processing can offer tools for enhancing 
productivity which were previously unaffordable for 

small and medium enterprises (SMEs), to strengthen 
the management of supply chains, requirements for 
resources and materials, and customer relationships.

Manufacturing execution systems (MES) are likely to 
become more important. These are computerised 
systems used to show the manufacturing decision 
maker how conditions on the factory floor can 
be optimised to improve production output. MES 
work in real time to enable the control of multiple 
elements of the production process such as inputs, 
personnel, machines and support services. Over the 
next decade, cloud-based software will move from 
specialist applications towards the shop floor.

Advanced and autonomous robotics65

In the next three decades, the development of 
powered exoskeletons (a wearable robotics suit), 
artificial and enhanced visual, aural and touch 
sensations, remote control and operation and 
artificial intelligence will make a number of routine 
operations within manufacturing, healthcare and 
surgery, food preparation, cleaning and consumer 
activities obsolete, and provide a wealth of 
opportunities for manufacturers. 

Autonomous and near-autonomous vehicles such 
as cars, drones, trains and ships will boost the 
development of computer vision, sensors including 
radar and GPS, communication with networks, 
and remote control algorithms. Current systems 
for machine vision are widely used for sorting, 
inspection and quality control. However, 3D vision 
and measurement systems are now becoming more 
commonplace, allowing control systems not only to 
distinguish between components but also to adapt 
conditions based on identified variation. On the 
human front, 3D vision will be able to track gestures, 
body motion, gaze and recognise faces, creating the 
potential for new products and applications as well 
as supporting robot and human co-working in the 
same operating space. 

Energy intelligence66

It is crucial, particularly for energy-intensive process 
industries, to understand a process plant’s energy 
needs and eliminate wasteful consumption by

collecting energy information from sensors, plant 
automation systems and sub-meters. As energy 
prices fluctuate in the future67, manufacturers 
will rely increasingly on energy intelligence to 
monitor and control energy consumption in their 
manufacturing operations. The growing trends in 
industry to improve corporate sustainability and 
implement energy and carbon reduction targets  
are expected to continue. 

Energy storage is a limiting factor in many 
technologies including consumer electronics, mobile 
computing, vehicles, remote mechanical systems and 
alternative energy production. If new ways to store 
energy at high density could be found through novel 
approaches to battery technology, nanoscience and 
advanced materials, multiple new applications and 
potential for new manufactured products would  
be achievable. 

Alternative energy resources are also expanding 
in commercial scope, facilitated by advances in 
technology, although petroleum and gas retain 
their importance in many manufacturing processes 
as critical components. New techniques such as 
hydraulic fracturing of shale rocks or ‘fracking’, 
horizontal drilling and microseismic monitoring 
will be important in the extraction of shale gas, 
light oil and coal-based methane. In addition, 
the requirement to mitigate climate change and 
conserve finite petroleum reserves is prompting 
the exploitation of solar, geothermal, wind, wave, 
hydroelectric and various forms of biofuels to 
assist in generating and distributing energy. This has 
implications for UK manufacturers in terms of the 
opportunities in providing and using new products.

Additive manufacturing (AM)68, 69

Additive manufacturing (or 3D printing) developed 
from advances in rapid prototyping technology. 
It produces parts by adding layers of material, 
rather than removing material, i.e. subtractive 
manufacturing, to build an object. It is expected to 
lead to profound changes in the way businesses 
make almost any product over the coming decades, 
becoming an essential tool allowing for: 

  A diverse range of products to be fully 

personalised to individual customer 
requirements, for example medical implants;

  Products to be made as lightweight as possible;
  Designs to be optimised to reduce waste;
 

Inventories of spare parts to be reduced, with 
data stored instead;

  Value chains being managed more effectively, 

reducing the need for complex operation 
sequences, raw materials, inventory buffers and 
extended supply chains;

  Greater flexibility in the location of 

manufacturing;

  Customers being able to make their own products;
  Potential for creating compatible tissues and 

organs for transplantation;

  Products to be made with new graded 

composition and bespoke properties; and

  Reduced dependence on moulds and  

product assembly.

Additive manufacturing has strong potential for 
being adopted in a range of industries, including 
aerospace, medical devices and implants, power 
generation, automotive, and the creative industries70. 
Research is now underway to produce parts in 
multiple materials, to accelerate production, to 
produce larger areas of material, and to integrate 
electro-mechanical systems into AM products71. 
The market for products made using additive 
manufacturing techniques is growing rapidly and will 
provide significant and transformative opportunities 
for UK manufacturers. For example, between 2010-
2012, the global market for AM products rose from 
US$1.3 billion to $1.9 billion72, with estimates for 
future market growth reaching $100 billion by 202073.

3. Faster, more responsive and closer to customersPrintable electronics74

The technologies underpinning printable electronics, 
for example ‘e-ink’ materials, and intelligent bar 
code systems such as RFIDs, have the potential to 
drive down the costs of digital displays, to compete 
with bar code printing. RFID tags in particular 
could disrupt many current ways of doing business 
in manufacturing by offering the prospect of low-
cost object and asset tracking, with sensors and 
computing integrated into products. An RFID tag 
on a manufactured product with integrated sensors 
could potentially detect physical, heat or moisture 
damage during storage or transit and subsequently 
provide a warning on an e-ink display. This is a 
rapidly developing area of technology with many 
potential opportunities for UK manufacturers. 

Integrated safety systems75

Many manufacturers have taken advantage of global 
safety standards to integrate rapidly advancing safety 
and plant automation systems. In doing so they have 
maintained their safety record without sacrificing 
productivity. Inter-communication between safety 
and quality control systems provides manufacturers 
with greater intelligence on the reasons for, and 
frequency of, adverse events and how best to 
identify them from massive amounts of complex 
safety data. Advanced process monitoring sensors 
and systems can create a process fingerprint and 
eliminate process anomalies, which are especially 
useful for ultra-high integrity products. Future 
adoption of these systems will rise as more UK 
manufacturers realise the benefits.

3.1.4 Future  
impacts and  
consequences  
oF technology  
advances

The development and maturation of new 
technologies often delivers the opportunities  
and implications envisaged at the time of inception. 
However, they can also have unintended impacts 
and consequences which were not anticipated. 
This section reviews some of the opportunities 
and challenges that the new technologies discussed 
above are likely to present. 

Product personalisation

The prospect of mass product personalisation 
over the coming decades in the UK will challenge 
the traditionally held view that a steep trade-off 
exists between cheap mass-produced ‘one-size-
fits-all’ products using economies of scale, and 
those tailored to individuals at substantially higher 
costs. This concept can be expressed as ’make-to-
stock‘ versus ’make-to-order‘ and will be driven by 
advances in additive manufacturing, new materials, 
computer-controlled tools, biotechnology, and green 
chemistry. In addition, direct customer input at the 
design stage will enable companies to produce 
customised, affordable, high quality goods and 
services with shorter cycle-times and lower costs 
associated with standardisation and mass production. 

Personalisation currently represents a small part of 
the global economy, although research suggests76 
that customers in developed economies are 
already prepared to pay a premium of 10% for 
some degree of personalisation. This is a significant 
opportunity for UK manufacturers, and innovative 
technologies are already making this option more 
feasible. Examples of personalised products include 
Nike trainers, Levi Strauss’s Original Spin, Swatch 
and Dulux colour combinations, made-to-order Dell 
computers and many durable goods such as cars.

The future of manufacturing: A new era of opportunity and challenge for the UK80

Sustainability and the circular economy

A key driver of future manufacturing is likely to be a 
shift to more sustainable manufacturing, which uses 
less material, energy and other inputs, and a shift to 
a ‘circular economy’ way of doing business, with end- 
of-life products reused as inputs. This shift in thinking 
is likely to generate real competitive advantage and 
differentiation compared to the largely incremental 
changes in efficiency currently being considered in 
manufacturing practice.

Manufacturing has, in recent decades, focused on 
production and consumption in which goods are 
manufactured from raw materials, sold, used and 
then discarded. This ‘linear economy’ approach is 
material and energy intensive, relies on economies 
of scale and uses complex and international supply 
chains. In the current system, approximately 80% of 
these materials finish their life in incinerators, landfill 
or wastewater. Estimates indicate that the total 
material value of consumer goods is US$3.2 trillion, 
with approximately 20% being recovered through 
decomposition, recycling, returning nutrients to the 
soil and cascading through adjacent supply chains. 
The circular economy offers an alternative pattern of 
resource deployment by creating more value from 
each unit of resource by recovering and regenerating 
products at the end of their service lives77. 

Designing and using durable and consumer goods 
such as cars, vans, white goods, mobile phones, 
food, beverages, textiles and packaging using circular 
principles could be worth up to US$700 billion per 
annum if fully adopted worldwide78. In the consumer 
goods sector, opportunities exist throughout the 
value chain in manufacturing (food and beverages), 
distribution and consumption (textiles and 
packaging) and disposal (food waste). For example, 
single-use biodegradable packaging can support 
the return of bio-based materials such as food to 
the soil when no other viable end-of-life options 
exist. These examples of the circular economy are 
inherently more productive than the traditional 
business models because they extract value from 
otherwise defunct resources.

In a fiercely competitive world of rising demand 
from consumers and dwindling natural resources, 
market forces will favour business models which 
create the most value per unit or resource. ’Circular’ 
business models will be promoted further by 
resource scarcity and tighter environmental standards, 
urbanisation that concentrates flows of consumer 
goods and wastes, developments in track-and-trace 
ICT, new packaging systems and discrete shifts in 
consumer behaviour, where access is preferred over 
ownership79. However, re-use and recycling requires 
different manufacturing capabilities and operational 
models, and will need new technologies to deliver 
globally competitive manufacturers. Chapter 5 
discusses this in further detail.

Intellectual property (IP) protection and  
new technologies80

The use of formal protection mechanisms for 
intellectual property rights (IPR), including patents, 
trademarks and industrial design rights, has increased 
in global importance over past decades as the 
knowledge economy established. Evidence suggests 
that IP ownership is positively related to the 
performance of enterprises81, although it is difficult 
to ascertain whether it is the IP protection or the 
underlying tangible assets which drives value. 

As manufacturing changes, businesses are paying 
more attention to their intellectual assets and 
devising new ways of managing their portfolios.  
For example, strategic patenting, when firms 
leverage complementarities between patents to 
obtain a strategic or defensive advantage over 
technological rivals, thereby creating patent ‘thickets’, 
is one such option. However, this can lead to low 
patent quality which barely satisfies the usual criteria 
of novelty and non-obviousness. Similarly, worldwide 
litigation over IP infringement has increased in 
proportion to the rise in patent filings and this trend 
is likely to continue unless firms can cross-license, 
create patent pools and resolve issues around 
royalty ‘stacking’82.

3. Faster, more responsive and closer to customers81

The introduction of new technologies such as 
wireless communication, additive manufacturing 
and biotechnology raise a new set of IP issues 
and challenges for manufacturers involving 
consumers, legislators, regulators and other 
stakeholders. One such example concerns the 
interaction of the ‘Internet of Things’ with the 
current IP and regulatory environment for wireless 
communication83. Embedded devices linked via 
wireless and near-field communications which 
communicate with intranets and the rest of the 
internet would require businesses to run their  
own networks for security reasons. However, in 
doing so they would encounter regulatory barriers 
regarding the use of private intellectual property. 
Similarly, customer-specific additive manufacturing 
may encounter infringement claims from third 
parties concerning their freedom to operate.  
These issues may also arise when this technology 
is used to repair or refurbish a patented product 
where there is a fine line between part-by-part 
replacement and reconstruction of the object  
in its entirety. Equivalent arguments could be 
presented in the case of cell-based therapies  
and 3D tissue construction. 

Cyber security84 and counterfeiting

The closed nature of conventional automation 
networks appeared, until recently, to be relatively 
immune from external security threats. However, 
the pervasiveness of the internet and mobile 
communications has allowed equipment and 
systems to be connected and controlled in a 
seamless fashion, with every connected asset now 
a vulnerability for its owners or users. Most leading 
manufacturers are implementing multiple levels of 
security to ensure that entire networks are not able 
to succumb to security breaches. 

Biosecurity, which encompasses preventative 
measures designed to reduce the risk of 
transmission of infectious diseases, invasive alien 
species, quarantined pests, genetically modified 
organisms and bioterrorist agents85, will require 
systems put in place to prevent the introduction 
and spread of pathogens in natural and managed 
ecosystems. In the future, biosecurity, like cyber 

security will require the cooperation of scientists, 
technicians, security engineers, law enforcement 
officials and policy-makers to combat real viruses 
rather than cyber viruses. 

Advanced 3D measurement, digital modelling and 
rapid prototyping technologies enable improved 
product and process development. However, they 
also facilitate reverse engineering, cloning and 
the production of counterfeit products. Security 
technologies including digital traceability must stay 
ahead of illegal operations to protect legitimate 
businesses and minimise risks of product safety.

Advanced technologies and changing  
skills requirements 

It will be critical for the future workforce to 
be highly skilled and flexible enough to allow 
manufacturers to embrace new technologies (see 
Chapter 6). For example, a supply of skilled workers 
and managers to manage big data will be essential, 
with the US already forecasting potential shortages 
of managers and analysts with the requisite skills 
by 201886 In addition, in a future age of distributed 
assets and an increasingly mobile workforce, 
management will need to be mobile to drive asset 
efficiency and overall business profitability. Simulation 
technologies will play a greater role in training the 
work force before they set foot on the shop floor. 

The nature of the workplace is also likely to 
alter substantially in most developed economies, 
including the UK, over the next four decades. 
Working practices and environments will change, 
the workforce will age and the requirement 
for mental rather than physical agility will grow. 
Human enhancement technology87 could 
contribute to improved workplace efficiency by 
increasing participation among those who might 
be disadvantaged or lifting the productivity of all 
employees beyond the current limits of human 
endurance (see Chapter 6).

3.2 Factories oF  
the Future

Key messages
Factories in developed economies and some 
emerging economies have undergone a 
transformation in recent decades as manufacturers 
have focused on labour and resource efficiency, 
adapted to new technologies including robotics 
and automation, and responded to opportunities 
in emerging economies. As a result, there is already 
a high level of diversity in the focus, scale and 
location of factories.

The factories of the future will vary, depending on 
specific sub-sectors and products. But the majority 
will be influenced by common trends driving 
change in processes and practices, locations, supply 
chains, goals and metrics, facilities, technology, 
people and culture (Figure 3.2).

It is likely that the factories of the future will 
be increasingly diverse, with multiple models 
of operation increasingly adopted by individual 
businesses, resulting in: 

  Capital intensive ‘super factories’ producing 

complex products

  Reconfigurable units integrated with the 

requirements of their supply chain partners
Localised and even home manufacturing for 
some products

 

  Mobile manufacturing, potentially at the bedside 

and in the battlefield

  More urban locations as the factory 

increasingly becomes a ‘good neighbour’88  
in terms of its environmental impact

These changes will be facilitated by an increase 
in standardised processes which can be rapidly 
configured utilising digital technology, to 
replicate proven production capabilities. New 
process technologies, allied with data-dependent 
mechanisation of production processes, will shift

The future of manufacturing: A new era of opportunity and challenge for the UK84

3.2.1 introduction

Like much infrastructure, given the investment 
required, factories are generally built for the 
longer term. Despite this, factories in the UK have 
undergone a transformation in recent decades 
as manufacturers have focused on labour and 
resource efficiency, adapted to new technologies 
including robotics and automation, and responded 
to opportunities in emerging economies. Significant 
economic, technological and environmental trends 
will influence factories of the future, and the value 
chains that they are part of. Proximity to the 
customer whether real or virtual, massive quantities 
of data, and new technologies that enable a change 
in the logic of scale will transform today’s factories 
into very different enterprises. 

3.2.2 what are the 
Future trends?

While it is not possible to forecast how factories in 
specific manufacturing sub-sectors will evolve over 
the next 40 years, a reliable strategic assessment of 
broad trends can be made. These are summarised in 
Figure 3.2, with a number of examples provided in 
Boxes 3.2 to 3.6 of factories moving in this direction, 
with further discussion below. 

 

Spatial changes: These will be at the heart of 
future developments. Factory locations are likely 
to become increasingly diverse and nearer to the 
customer’s home. Facilities will include smaller, 
centralised hubs and more urban locations 
as the factory increasingly becomes a ‘good 
neighbour’89 in terms of its environmental impact. 
Factories are also likely to be more distributed 
and more mobile, resulting in developments 
such as manufacturing at the bedside and in 
the battlefield. For complex products, some 
manufacturing activities will migrate to larger, 
more capital intensive ‘super factories’ while 
others will become reconfigurable units co-
located and integrated with associated supply 
chain partners. 

  Technological developments: Advances in additive 

manufacturing and other technologies will allow 
factories on a micro scale to become much 
more common, to the point where some people 
undertake manufacturing at home. Factories 
will become more agile and able to respond 
quickly and flexibly to customer demands due to 
their flexible machinery, staff and infrastructure, 
enabling the ‘reconfigurable factory’90. Factors 
such as fast progression from manual to 
automated manufacturing through greater 
process control are expected to play a growing 
role in the factory of the future. Factories will 
become more open to customers, supporting 
closer manufacturer-customer relationships. 
  New process technologies: When allied with 
data-rich, mechanised production processes, 
these technologies will shift the key competences 
away from traditional production engineering 
and operational management to information 
processing and digital control. The role of the 
computer in managing complex and adaptable 
manufacturing systems, to support decisions 
concerning what is made where, and to feedback 
data from use, will change operational decision-
making. The huge increase in data fed back from 
users, combined with the increased competence 
of computer simulations to accurately model 
production processes and value chains, will allow 
manufacturers to model factory designs and 
alternative strategies before initial commitment, 
during implementation, and subsequent evaluation.
‘Information-production engineers’: Manufacturers 
will compete on their ability to create value 
through the smart use of ICT. Employees will 
be hired for knowledge-based roles related to 
production, instead of those based on manual 
work. Information-production-engineers will 
design factories, re-configure them as required, 
and remotely assess output quality. They will 
design products to be made by ‘listening’ to 
customers as well as guiding their use and repair 
in the field. Workers with technical capability and 
a breadth of other skills including commercial 
competence and problem solving abilities will  
be in demand (see Chapter 6).

3. Faster, more responsive and closer to customers85

  Data and digital technologies: Firms will need 
to embrace new digital technologies to make 
sense of the proliferation of data, which will 
be important in remaining up to date with 
customer demand. The best manufacturers will 
use data directly captured from customers to 
offer a superior service. Consumers recognise 
this today in the surprising ‘intelligence’ with 
which loyalty cards target special offers. Out to 
2050, second-by-second data on usage will allow 
manufacturers to alter products while in use 
(for example through the sending of a signal to 
stop the use of a phone which requires repair, 
or altering the software in a bicycle to provide 
feedback on training techniques appropriate to 
the customer’s riding style). Firms will also take 
advantage of flexible automation and robotics 
which adapt processes in response to feedback.
  People and culture: Factories of the future are 
likely to be centres of creativity and innovation, 
operating in networks of relationships, for 
example with suppliers and universities, where 
skilled people use world-class technologies  
and processes to create new ways of adding 
value, often working remotely. The ‘command  
and control’ approach to management used  
by professional and technical workers will 
become outdated. 

It is critical that UK factories continue evolving, 
particularly as the pace of technological 
development continues, to seize new opportunities 
and ensure that manufacturers are able to  
compete internationally and leverage additional  
and new value91. However, as factories are typically 
built for the long term, there is a chance that 
emerging markets could become the destinations  
of choice for some of the newest approaches  
to manufacturing92. 

Mobile factory sites which can move closer to 
target markets and remanufacturing sites are already 
operating in countries such as India. Brandix India 
Apparel City is an integrated supply chain city 
located in Andhra Pradesh is one example (see 
Box 3.6). This growing challenge creates an even 
greater need for effective government policy to 
stimulate and support UK manufacturers to invest 
and change in order to ensure they get ahead of 
the game. This is particularly in terms of supporting 
collaboration between firms and sharing of best 
practice, and using industrial policies to enable the 
next generation of factories to develop (Chapter 7).

Box 3.2: the customer experience  
(vw autostadt, the city oF cars)93
The Autostadt complex in Wolfsburg, Germany, 
offers ‘an enjoyable experience for the whole family’. 
Here the customer can specify his or her new car, 
watch the car being made and see it come off the 
production line. Inside the complex, there are a 
variety of driving and car-related attractions (from 
educational and historical displays, art exhibitions, 
driving experiences on all-terrain tracks, and a 
children’s driving school). There are restaurants, 
shops and even hotels so that customers can stay 
for a few days.

The car distribution centre offers a staged process 
for car collection in which car-buying customers are 
given vouchers to use in restaurants and other parts 
of the complex as the car buying and preparation 
process commences. Combining museum, 
entertainment and vehicle purchase, the Autostadt 
is an example of growing interaction between 
previously distant factories and consumers.

Box 3.3: Fast and FlexiBle  
(loadhog in sheFField)94
Loadhog manufactures innovative handling and logistics products including re-usable pallets and storage devices. 
It is a good example of features such as fast progression from manual through semi-automated to automated 
manufacture, and greater process control.

Loadhog have successfully improved the characterisation of their production processes by through use of 
simulation and modelling. They use this knowledge to accelerate through the slower, manual production to 
faster, automated production. Achieving this ‘ramp-up’ faster than their competitors and at reduced capital cost 
(by replacing expensive hard tooling with computer controlled automation) is a critical competence in medium-
volume, customisable product manufacture. The firm uses sophisticated computer aided design (CAD) software 
to design prototypes which avoids commitment to hard automation or tooling. 

There is a dedicated ‘ideas and innovation’ centre, made up of 10 designers and engineers, an extensive 
engineering workshop, CAD and rapid prototyping facilities. The majority of prototypes are developed on-site 
with an exceptionally rapid turn-around of ideas. The most successful projects have been carried out in close 
collaboration with customers.

Box 3.4: Focus on design  
(vitsoe – ‘against oBsolesce’)95
Unlike most furniture designers who design new products that change with fashion, Vitsoe is based in London 
and has focuses on creating furniture that can last for generations. Customers are asked to photograph 
their living space so that Vitsoe can design a specific solution. Over the product’s life time the customer is 
encouraged to return for help in adapting the product to their changing needs. Great care is taken to ensure 
that maximum customer value is not just delivered at point-of-sale but throughout the product’s life.

The products created by Vitsoe do not become obsolete. For example, new parts required for a Vitsoe shelving 
unit bought 50 years ago can be purchased today. Many aspects of Vitsoe’s approach are directed towards 
sustainability: encouraging less wastage by consumers, using the least amount of materials to create the product 
and emitting minimal pollution during the production and life-time of the product.

Box 3.5: a good neighBour  
(caterpillar re-manuFacturing services)96 
Caterpillar has been providing re-manufacturing services for over 20 years and has a European re-manufacturing site 
located in Shrewsbury, UK. A leader in re-manufacturing technologies and processes, ‘Cat Reman’ returns products 
at the end of their lives (called ‘core’) to same-as-new condition and helps reduce owning and operating costs 
by providing customers same-as-new quality at a fraction of the cost of a new part. Cat Reman operations are 
sustainable, with a goal of zero waste going to landfills.

Once a returned core arrives at a Reman facility, it is disassembled down to the smallest part, losing its original 
identity. Each element goes through a cleaning process and is inspected against strict engineering specifications 
to determine if it can be effectively salvaged. Accepted ‘worn out’ components are converted into production-
ready material through salvage techniques. The process of re-manufacturing requires 85-95% less energy and 
material than manufacture of the same, new component.

3. Faster, more responsive and closer to customers87

These technologies, including pervasive 
ICT, embedded sensors, big data, additive 
manufacturing, and advanced materials will rapidly 
become available to boost the capability of UK 
manufacturers. It is therefore reasonable to 
anticipate the need for strong future technological 
competence in UK manufacturing. 

Government must continue to increase its 
efforts in supporting the successful development, 
commercialisation and utilisation of future ideas 
and technology for the UK manufacturing sector, 
with specific future focus on:

 

Improving the speed, protection and co-
ordination of the UK technology pipe-line 
in areas relevant to UK manufacturing. This 
includes spotting high potential technologies 
which are relevant across the manufacturing 
sector, to improve competitiveness; 

  Greater leveraging of the UK’s intellectual 

assets for technology directed at driving 
competitiveness;

  Using technology to keep the UK a world 

 

leader in manufacturing services;
Supporting competence in design, simulation, 
personalisation and ‘information-dense’ 
products;

  Encouraging factories to pre-empt future 

volume sensitivity and become reconfigurable;
  Using advanced technology to reduce energy, 
water and raw materials in manufacturing; and 

  Anticipating potential intellectual property, 

cyber and bio-security issues.

Box 3.6: new Business models 
(Brandix india apparel city (Biac))
BIAC is a unique city based on an integrated  
apparel supply chain for fabrics, threads, buttons and 
hangers which is being developed in Visakhapatnam, 
Andhra Pradesh, India. A ‘Fibre to Store’ concept  
has been created by siting a vertically integrated 
value chain in one location, which included R&D  
and branding activities.

BIAC offers the convenience of an industrial city 
with modern infrastructure including ‘plug and play’ 
facilities for immediate production. All business 
partners are provided with rapid access to facilities 
to meet all their requirements from sourcing to 
transportation. Greater efficiency in distribution is 
ensured through the single location of all value chain 
partners and a centralised logistics unit. BIAC enjoys 
financial benefits from the government of India 
which is extended to all partners who invest and  
set up in BIAC.

3.3  
implications For  
government

Key messages
Technology will become increasingly important 
to the UK’s manufacturing competitiveness in the 
decades ahead, particularly in the context of wider 
changes and uncertainties in the world. It will play 
a key role in facilitating the development of new 
business models. 

As a variety of cross-sector areas of technology 
develop, they are likely to make manufacturing 
faster, more responsive and closer to consumers. 
This will lead to a revolution in designing, making, 
offering, using and recycling products. 

The future of manufacturing: A new era of opportunity and challenge for the UK88

This section discusses seven areas, listed above, which 
Government will need to address to ensure that 
the UK benefits from a likely revolution in designing, 
making, offering, using and recycling products. 

3.3.1 improving the 
speed, protection 
and coordination 
oF the uK  
technology  
pipe-line in areas 
relevant to uK  
manuFacturing

The development of a number of pervasive 
primary (underpinning) and secondary (contingent) 
technologies are being driven by advances in specific 
areas of technology, and other non-technological 
changes. These include older and wealthier 
populations creating demand for new products, 
pressure on resources (see Chapter 5), and 
international competition driving manufacturers  
to increase their productivity (see Chapter 4). 

Global technology development can be described as 
a ‘pipeline’ of new technologies becoming available 
from discovery and research activities, through 
to commercialisation. Many of the technologies 
detailed earlier in this Chapter are being developed 
in the UK. The pipe-line model (see Figure 3.3) 
sets out the way in which technologies and related 
intellectual property move through Technology 
Readiness Levels (TRLs)97. It is also possible to make 
this pipe-line more specific to the manufacturing 
sector, where the assessment and validation  
needed before a technology becomes suitable  
for production are emphasised (see Figure 3.4).

Some of the technologies moving through the 
technology readiness levels that are likely to be of 
future significance to manufacturing are already 
well known. However, the consequences of some 
of the technologies will be radical, bringing new 
performance in value delivery over the next few 
decades. Biotechnology, for example, will affect 
not only the products of manufacturing, but also 
the way in which manufacturing processes are 
performed. For example, it is already possible to 
envisage personalised medicines being made in close 
proximity to a patient. It is less easy to predict the 
impact of technologies that are yet to appear or  
be commercialised.

The already substantial impact of enabling 
technologies on the manufacturing sector, such 
as ICT, is expected to continue98. Technologies 
will become increasingly pervasive and will re-
shape global manufacturing activities, enabling new 
business models and opportunities for market 
offerings through increased speed, proximity 
and depth of relationship with customers99. The 
aspiration to create goods that are ‘circular by 
design’ and ‘green’ will encourage higher rates of 
technological development, and improved materials, 
labour and energy efficiency with correspondingly 
greater opportunities for wealth creation. These 
technologies, including ICT, biotechnology, sensors, 
new materials and green chemistry, will be equally 
available to UK manufacturers and competitors. The 
ability to utilise them effectively will help determine 
which firms remain as manufacturers and which 
become actors in a supply network dominated by 
those organisations able to muster technologies to 
deliver the greatest value. 

The UK currently has a high level of expertise in 
many areas of technological development including 
biotechnology, additive manufacturing, hybrid 
materials, and some areas of green chemistry100. 
It also has important competencies in high-tech 
aerospace and biopharmaceutical products, and 

is likely to be well positioned, for example, in the 
market for human enhancement technologies which 
is set to grow as the ageing population increases101. 
There is good potential for the use of this expertise 
in the UK to develop new forms of manufacturing 
with strong export potential, for example precision 
agriculture and on-farm processing. 

As some of the new technologies with applications 
in manufacturing such as ICT, biotechnology and 
sensors may be owned and made outside of the UK, 
the greatest advantage will go to those companies 
that experiment and learn the most rapidly, scaling 
up the technology and exploiting it to the greatest 
extent possible. These generic competences 
can help maximise the value from each of these 
technological shifts. This will enable the UK to 
experiment with emerging technologies and gain 
advantage from early use of the technology, whether 
home-grown or not. 

The UK’s technology pipeline has in recent years 
been recognised as faltering between invention 
and exploitation, at the stage known as the ‘valley 
of death’102. The UK’s TRL system is currently based 
on research funded by the UK Research Councils, 
which focuses on early stage research, progressing 
into innovation and commercialisation-focused

activity supported by the Technology Strategy Board 
(TSB). A typical TSB project will move a technology 
by one or two TRLs103 in the 3-5 range. However, 
academic experts that lead early research (levels 
1-3) generally do not necessarily have the same 
inclination or motivation to follow up their work at 
later levels. There have been some steps to remedy 
any disconnect, such as a joint partnership in high 
value manufacturing between the Engineering and 
Physical Sciences Research Council and the TSB104, 
and the introduction of the High Value Manufacturing 
Catapult Centre (HVM Catapult). However, greater 
investment is needed to ensure seamless transitions 
between the various TRL levels and to motivate 
academics to contribute to all TRL levels. 

Given the pace of change likely to occur in 
technological developments and international 
competition, the speed and coordination of  
a comprehensive technology pipeline will be  
critical in enhancing UK capability and maximising 
export potential. 

advice For policy maKers:
Greater support for technologies at technology 
readiness levels three to five

There is a need for more partnering of academics 
in different institutions, potentially via the High 
Value Manufacturing Catapult Centre, to support 
experimentation with new technologies to 
encourage early development, to identify and 
start to target ‘routes to market’ and to eventually 
support work at higher technology readiness levels. 

There is also a need to overcome financing 
weaknesses in the current system for these 
technology readiness levels. Financing must be made 
more risk-competent to bridge the ‘valley of death’, 
through the role of procurement, risk-sharing fiscal 
instruments, and encouragement of SME R&D. 

Government procurement can play a critical 
part in enabling innovation and technology 
commercialisation. The innovative model of ‘forward 
commitment procurement’ could stimulate UK 

manufacturing by purchasing ultimate outcomes 
rather than focusing on immediate needs, and risk-
reducing the investment plans of manufacturers. 
International policies such as the current EU rules 
limiting direct buying from UK suppliers are current 
barriers to these initiatives105.

Strengthening the role of the UK’s High Value 
Manufacturing Catapult Centre106

Since its launch in October 2011, the HVM Catapult, 
including its seven member centres, has worked 
with industry and academic partners to focus on 
accelerating the commercialisation of new and 
emerging manufacturing technologies107.

In the 2012-13 financial year, the Centre leveraged 
£2 of private sector investment for every £1 of 
core public funding, a strong performance given that 
member centres are still developing. The TSB, which 
funds the Centre, typically achieves a return of 
£6.71 for the economy for every £1.00 invested in 
collaborative research and development projects108, 
with an annual budget of around £440 million. The 
direct translation of newly delivered technology 
into improvements in manufacturing performance, 
competitive advantage and jobs is a major benefit  
of HVM Catapult associated activities. 

An immediate priority should be to increase the 
scale of funding for the HVM Catapult Centre, 
to ensure that the legacy membership models of 
some of the member centres do not restrict the 
future involvement of small and medium enterprises. 
Longer term, there is potential for the Centre 
to support international collaboration between 
manufacturers, for example by establishing  
a presence in key developing economies. 

In addition, analysis should also consider how 
comparable international research technology 
organisations are funded, sponsored and led, 
including the network of 66 Fraunhofer centres in 
Germany and the U.S. Defense Advanced Research 
Projects Agency.

Composites Centre; and the UK Energy Storage R&D Centre. By March 2013, it had secured access to an asset base of around £250million hi-tech 
equipment and infrastructure operated by over 900 staff (increase of over 150 in 6 months). There has also been a significant increase in SME engagement, 
with the Centre enabling SMEs to partner in ca. £45m of collaborative R&D project value. 108 Public and Corporate Economic Consultants (2011) 

3. Faster, more responsive and closer to customers91

3.3.2 greater  
leveraging oF the 
uK’s intellectual 
assets

The UK is well regarded internationally for the 
quality of its education system109 and the high quality 
of its universities110, with the 2012 Academic Ranking 
of World Universities placing two UK universities 
in the top 10. In country rankings of its university 
sector, the UK is second to the US and well ahead 
of its nearest competitors of Japan, Germany and 
France111. Of the BRIC nations, only Russia has any 
university in the top 100, whilst China has only 7 
ranked in the top 200, compared to 14 in Germany, 
19 in the UK and 85 in the US. 

However, US universities not only dominate the 
list of the top research-intensive universities in the 
world, but they are also foremost in the creation 
of intellectual property. The UK, on the other hand, 
is a less prolific patent filer. In 2011, the US led 
the top 15 countries in filing international patent 
applications, followed by Japan and Germany, which 
collectively accounted for 58% of the world’s output, 
with China, South Korea, France, the UK, Switzerland, 
Holland and Sweden filling the remaining top 10 
places112. However, among the top filing countries, 
patent applications from China (33.4%), Japan (21%), 
Canada (8.3%), South Korea (8%) and the US (8%) 
saw the fastest growth in 2011. 

There is a case for greater future leveraging of the 
intellectual assets of the UK for the benefit of the 
manufacturing sector and the wider economy113. 
This would entail a thorough analysis of the 
invention-innovation-exploitation trail and where 
the bottlenecks to smooth passage occur. Issues 
that might be addressed include the creation of 
resources to encourage patenting and maintain 
new inventions within the higher education sector 
and the widespread adoption of the ‘Patent Box’ 
concept. This leveraging might include, for example, a 
concerted approach to technology support involving 
NHS procurement, the TSB, Research Councils, 

universities, and manufacturers working together on 
personalised medicine targeted at an ageing society. 
This is clearly a growing global market where the UK 
has broad competence114. Another option would be 
to identify a small number of ‘National Investment 
Projects’ in high value manufacturing such as the next 
generation single aisle aircraft which, if supported at 
sufficient scale could see the UK playing a leading role 
in one of the biggest future job and wealth creation 
opportunities available.

advice For policy maKers:
Placing greater emphasis on the importance of 
applied research and commercialisation

  Government will need to work more closely 

with research councils, universities and learned 
societies to encourage academics to undertake 
research programmes that strike a balance 
between pure, applied and challenge-led 
research. One potential option might be  
to put in place incentives to commercialise 
applied research. 

  The UK’s poor performance in total R&D 
expenditure is due to both its weak public 
and industry R&D spending relative to other 
countries. For example, UK government 
funding for R&D was 0.57% of GDP in 2011 
while industry support was 1.2% of GDP. 
By comparison, during the same year, US 
government expenditure was 0.92% and  
industry R&D support was 1.84% of GDP (see 
Chapter 4). UK Government needs to not only 
increase its own R&D spend, but to encourage 
and support industry to do the same.

Taking a joined-up approach to exploiting 
technologies for the manufacturing sector

  A number of the technological developments 

in this chapter need to be given greater 
strategic oversight to identify and implement 
strategies for their exploitation for the benefit 
of the UK manufacturing sector, and beyond. 
For example, a TSB Special Interest Group has 
recently considered how the UK can best exploit 
additive Manufacturing technology115. This work 
demonstrates there is much to be done to 
identify the most effective routes to implement 
additive manufacturing in the UK manufacturing

sector, with a need to strengthen engagement 
between the UK supply chain, end-users and the 
research base.

  There is a need to support, potentially via the 
High Value Manufacturing Catapult Centre, the 
development of industry-academia-government 
technology roadmaps that can spot relevant 
developments, particularly those which operate 
across sub-sectors, and guide policy. This might 
then produce action plans for the wider co-
ordination of technology road-mapping across 
government, business and academia. 

  This roadmap approach, along with a more 

aggressive investment plan supporting large scale 
demonstrator infrastructure and applications 
development, could see the UK becoming a 
world leader in technology, especially if ‘keystone’ 
IP can be secured by UK based companies. 
This work could also build on the evidence 
underpinning the government’s recent £600 
million investment in ‘Eight Great Technologies’116. 

3.3.3 using  
technology to 
Keep the uK a 
world leader in 
manuFacturing 
services 

and product operational data (big data) into 
revenue through the development of new business 
models embracing trends including personalisation 
of products. ICT is rapidly assuming a pivotal 
position in manufacturing and often commences 
with defining customer needs, design and 
representation of products by Computer Aided 
Design (CAD), production planning and scheduling, 
Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM), sales  
and distribution online, and performance feedback 
through embedded sensors117. The manufacture  
of advanced information-dense products will  
require highly specialised design methodologies  
and tools, and sophisticated supply chain 
management and customers. 

The new manufacturing services business models 
that will become mainstream out to 2050 will 
involve customers increasingly purchasing life-time 
care along with their product, or purely buying 
a function rather than the product, for example, 
paying per copy rather than buying a photocopier. 
Manufacturers will need to take greater care of the 
long term performance of their products, to the 
point of monitoring and sending out engineers to 
the customer. These new business models, enabled 
by technologies described earlier, are already 
changing the way that manufacturers design, make 
and service products globally. Given the potential 
value creation these new business models support, 
there is an important role for government, as 
discussed in Chapter 4. 

Given its history in developing high technology 
products, the UK has strong capability in the 
integration of ICT and sensors with tacit knowledge 
to deliver value-adding services, and even integrating 
them into full ‘function-delivery’ services. In the 
decades ahead, it is likely that leaders such as Rolls-
Royce plc will be joined by other manufacturers 
using their knowledge of products and technology 
to sell services globally. It is now relatively easy to 
offer technical advice across great distance. However 
this approach will increasingly rely on sensors which 
travel with the product, combined with ubiquitous 
computing capacity and tacit knowledge. 

In addition to manufacturing services, this general 
strategy offers the potential to turn know-how  

3.3.4 supporting  
competence in  
design, simulation,  
personalisation 
and ‘inFormation- 
dense’ products

As consumers increasingly seek, and pay for, 
products and services that match individual  
needs more closely, technologies that enable  
precise requirements to be met (for example 
personalised clothing, newsletters, consumer  
goods and medicine)118 are beginning to emerge. 

116 Technology Strategy Board (2012a) 117 For further details: Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (2013a) 118 Evidence Paper 6: Dickens et 
al. (2013)

3. Faster, more responsive and closer to customersHowever, true mass personalisation of other 
consumer products at low cost is within sight.  
A combination of improvements in ICT, consumer-
input, automation and additive manufacturing 
will increase the potential for offering individually 
tailored products under conditions that traditionally 
were seen as unfeasible119. Like manufacturing 
services, personalisation implies a high competence 
in a base technology plus a sophisticated aggregation 
of information. Those manufacturers who can deliver 
this shift in value are likely to realise higher margins, 
high quality jobs and product leadership. 

The UK is well positioned to lead the potential 
paradigm shift to personalised manufacturing,  
given its competence in areas including design  
and additive manufacturing, with a potential first 
step being the building of further competence 
in semi-customised products, possibly via more 
extensive use of consumer-designed and requested 
options. To exploit opportunities presented by  
mass personalisation, understanding consumer 
needs combined with strong design skills will be 
required to adapt products to rapidly shifting 
consumer tastes and trends. Similarly, modelling 
and simulation are expected to play an increasingly 
important part in manufacturing at the stage of 
design and optimisation120.

Products are also likely to become increasingly 
‘information-dense’ or ‘informated’ enabling not 
only the personalisation and services mentioned 
above, but also explaining the provenance and 
‘green’ credentials of products as consumers seek 
easy access to data about what they eat, wear and 
buy. These products will also potentially, via sensors, 
be able to feedback usage data to designers to 
improve the next generation of the product, and to 
offer advice or comment to the user to optimise 
pleasurable use. However, these types of advances 
would have consequences for open data exchange, 
cyber security issues, the protection of intellectual 
property121, and open trade agreements.

3.3.5  
encouraging  
Factories to  
pre-empt Future 
volume sensitivity  
and Become  
reconFiguraBle

One potential consequence of combining future 
technologies is a shift in the volume sensitivity 
of many manufacturing products, driven by for 
example distributed models of manufacturing, and 
collaborative consumption. The latter refers to 
economic arrangements in which participants share 
access to products or services, rather than have 
individual ownership. This likely trend implies that 
the scale of many factories will get smaller over the 
next decades for many sectors. 

For some product categories, distributed or 
even home manufacturing will be undertaken by 
consumers sharing data and using technologies, 
including additive manufacturing. This sharing of  
data, potentially in the form of product designs, 
would have a range of consequences for the 
protection of intellectual property122, and could 
bring about radical new business models relating to 
the ownership of products, with data and designs 
becoming more valuable than the product. The 
evolution of these products is likely to occur in 
different ways depending on the manufacturing  
sub-sectors, and factors including safety, regulatory 
and quality requirements.

Another factor likely to have an unpredictable 
impact on the volume sensitivity of factories are 
potential changes in the ownership of products, 
with the rise in collaborative consumption, which 
encompasses old world behaviours such as  
lending, exchange, swapping and bartering that  
are now able to operate at scale and across 
geographic boundaries, enabled by technology.  
This phenomenon could have a significant impact on 
the demand for products and the length of their life 
cycles. It may become established first in developed 

119 Personalised medicine is a medical practice that uses an individual’s genetic profile, ascertained via whole genome sequencing or a companion 
diagnostic, to guide decisions made in regard to the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease. 120 Hart, C. (1995) 120 Evidence Paper 6: Dickens, P.

economies as technology and human ingenuity 
combine to develop new ways of sharing, lending 
and exchanging time, skills and resources123, although 
such changes will also occur in highly creative 
emerging economies.

Factories are therefore likely to move closer to 
customers, build more localised products, and use 
more local materials, which will change the shape of 
the supply chain and lead to possible collaborative 
supply networks. For example, in cell-based 
therapies, particularly those exploiting the patient’s 
own or autologous cells, treatments are likely to 
be conducted at the point-of-care, i.e. the bedside, 
care centre or hospital, in which case, the ’factory’ 
becomes a device or instrument located adjacent, 
or in close proximity, to the ‘customer’. These cell-
based ‘factories’ and other consumer goods factories 
are likely to be supported remotely with sensors 
informing experts about the state of equipment 
and the flow of energy and materials, as well as 
the quality of products and staff. The factory of the 
future will be able to re-configure itself rapidly to 
make a variety of products124 using ICT hardware, 
simulation modelling and biotechnology. 

Bringing these potential developments together, 
a future challenge for manufacturing firms will be 
to coordinate an efficient value creation process 
in the factories of the future. These factories 
will be required to deliver more value, often in 
collaboration with others, be more connected 
globally and locally, and offer services integrated  
with physical outputs125.

advice For policy maKers:
Helping factories, as they diversify in form and 
function, to become reconfigurable

Factories of the future are likely to include 
more urban locations as the factory increasingly 
becomes a ‘good neighbour’126 in terms of its 
environmental impact. Planning regulations will need 
to accommodate potential changes in land use, 
particularly as these factories are likely to undertake 
a range of activities.

The Research Councils, the TSB and the High Value 
Manufacturing Catapult Centre should work with 
industry to develop enhanced technical expertise 

relating to the design of agile, reconfigurable 
factories and extended enterprises. This enhanced 
expertise could then be used to provide future 
support factories becoming reconfigurable.

3.3.6 using advanced  
technology to  
reduce energy,  
water and raw  
materials in  
manuFacturing

As products increasingly become ‘informated’ with 
information relating to their use and provenance, 
a large material component to the value exchange 
with customers will remain. This will be influenced 
by growing environmental and social forces. 

Resources such as energy, materials, land and 
water are likely to become scarcer, with availability 
increasingly volatile in the coming decades127 (see 
Chapter 5). Manufacturing activities currently rely 
on these resources, so scarcity due to either global 
shortages or lack of access caused by geopolitical 
factors, is likely to be a key challenge for the entire 
sector in the UK128. Manufacturers who learn how 
to make their products with less energy, water  
and raw materials than their competitors will be 
more resilient during likely periods of disruption.  
A major part of this shift to produce products with 
fewer resources will be the movement towards  
the circular economy, with end of life products  
re-entering the manufacturing value chain as they 
are re-used, re-manufactured or recycled. 

The market for technologies and knowledge that 
enable resource-efficient production will grow 
quickly, with a potential role for government 
procurement in ‘nudging’ and stimulating 
developments, whilst avoiding unintended 
consequences. The emergence of technologies 
that will help manufacturers use less resource to 
deliver value, for example lightweight materials and 
products, are likely to become more widely available 
over the next two decades. UK manufacturing 
activities must continue to adapt to best practice, 

123 For further details see: Nesta (2013) 124 Evidence Paper 29: Ridgeway, K et al et al (2013) 125 Evidence Paper 29: Ridgeway, K et al et al (2013)

3. Faster, more responsive and closer to customers95

particularly in the light of resource pressures. It is 
expected that future best practice will include fast 
response to market, product service systems and 
greater operational agility129. Evidence suggests there 
is no reason that the UK cannot match, or better, 
management practices from overseas130.

The technologies that develop can be considered 
enablers of a revolutionary change in the 
relationship between producer and consumer, with 
new business models likely to be used to ensure 
that the customer receives the maximum value for 
the minimum of material, water, and energy input. 
For example, business models might be based on 
cooperation between competitors with shared 
concerns about resources, or might include selling 
services to customers and retaining ownership 
of hard-won molecular properties so that their 
value can be re-gained after end of first use. These 
developments are discussed further in Chapter 5.

3.3.7 anticipating 
potential  
intellectual  
property, cyBer 
and Bio-security 
issues

New paradigms for innovation (involving ICT, the 
internet of things, mobile and cloud computing, 
additive manufacturing and biotechnology) raise a 
new set of requirements for intellectual property, 
business models, cyber and bio-security, and  
skills, which will have to be met by the combined 
efforts of consumers, legislators, regulators and 
other stakeholders. 

The most important industry in terms of copyright 
protection in the manufacturing sector is currently 
considered the ‘publishing, printing, and reproduction 
of recorded media industry’131. However, it is 
likely that this industry will be challenged in the 
future by growth in the ICT sector, facilitated by 
developments in technology. Greater availability of 
information is likely to support the development 
of additive manufacturing, with likely increases in 

copying of a patented object for personal use, which 
may go largely undetected132.

The ease of copying created by additive 
manufacturing is also likely to reduce any returns to 
operating manufacturing at scale, which implies that 
preventing imitation through a minimum efficient 
scale requirement becomes less feasible. This may 
increase the importance of using legal means to 
prevent imitation, alongside agile strategies that keep 
companies ahead of ‘home makers’. At the same 
time, the opportunity to customise and build upon 
another’s design may lead to innovation and new 
business opportunities. Strict patent enforcement 
may hinder this activity133. 

Of particular concern is the potential vulnerability 
of future advanced, information-rich products and 
services to external cyber attack. In addition, bio-
security, like the more traditional cyber security, will 
require the cooperation of scientists, technicians, 
security engineers, law enforcement officials and 
policy makers to combat the disabling or theft of 
valuable and easily transportable bio-assets. 

advice For policy maKers:
Protecting intellectual property without  
inhibiting innovation

There is a clear need to strike a balance between 
protecting intellectual property, as technologies 
including additive manufacturing increase the ease 
of copying products, and supporting innovation as 
product designs are developed and enhanced. Any 
future approach taken to the protection of intellectual 
property will need to be both flexible and pragmatic. 

Protecting sensitive data potentially vulnerable  
to cyber attack

It is important that the UK places systems and 
practices into effect to prevent intrusions and theft 
of sensitive data and knowledge. Similar policies may 
need to be adopted for the protection of novel 
assets of enormous value in the bio-economy.

Demand for new products will increase from emerging

International ‘fragmentation’ of manufacturing value 
chains will continue to be driven by advances in ICT 
and other areas. Smaller but important shifts such as 
onshoring of production back to the UK, driven by  
factors including changing labour costs, will influence 
the geography of manufacturing.

expected in global trade and investment. It also  
examines the changing spatial distribution of 
manufacturing, and trends including  
deindustrialisation and reindustrialisation.

The Chapter concludes by outlining a range of 
implications for Government, and relevant advice where 
needed, that will need to be addressed as manufacturing 
becomes exposed to new market opportunities.

4.1 Global tradE

kEy mEssaGEs

The UK has significant strengths in exporting 
manufactured goods.

  UK exports of goods produced by the 

manufacturing sector totalled £256 billion  
in 2012, accounting for around 53% of all  
UK exports1. 

  The UK is the 10th largest exporter of 

manufactured goods globally, accounting for 
about 2.9% of total world exports of goods 
in 2012, with pharmaceuticals, aerospace, 
chemicals, the automotive sector, beverages  
and spirits, boilers and machinery displaying 
strong performance. Export intensity increased 
from 30% of output in 1991 to 47% in 2011. 

  The UK’s share of global manufacturing exports 

 

has fallen from 7.2% in 1980 to 2.9% in 2012.
‘Superstar exporters’ (exporting 10 or more 
products to 10 or more markets) are dominant 
in export performance, accounting for 76% of 
the total value of UK manufacturing exports. 

  The UK share of global, high technology, 

manufacturing exports of 4.7% indicates that 
high-tech manufacturing exports may be  
a continuing area of comparative advantage  
for the UK.

  The 2012 Budget ambition to double UK 

exports to £1 trillion by 20202 implies export 
growth of 9% per annum. If UK manufacturing 
exports doubled by 2020, this would suggest 
exporting 78% of all UK manufacturing output. 
Germany currently exports 57%. On current 
trends, manufacturing exports would not 
double before 2032. 

As the global economy changes and future markets 
emerge, EU and US markets will continue to be 
important for the UK in the medium to long term.

  The UK exported to 226 different countries/

territories in 2010, with the US the most 
important destination accounting for 13% of 

the value of exports. EU markets accounted for 
about 54% of the total value of UK exports in 
2012, while BRIC exports were only 8%. 

  The BRIC economies are likely to become 
larger than the US by 2015, and the G7 by 
2032. The UK is low down the global list of 
exporters to China (24th) and India (21st) 
in terms of the value of exports, with the 
UK’s current share of imports to countries 
forecast to be in the top 30 economies by 2050 
generally disappointing, given its 2.9% share 
of total world exports in 2012. As the UK is 
currently poorly placed in these markets, it is 
not expected to benefit significantly from their 
future growth. 

Policies for strengthening the balance of payments 
must assign a role to manufacturing. 

  The UK’s overall current balance of payments, 

including investment income, was -3.7% of 
gross domestic product (GDP) in 2012. A 
baseline scenario for 2022 indicates if trends 
continue, with sustained economic recovery, 
a current account deficit equal to 3% of GDP 
may be reached by 2022. The pessimistic 
scenario would be a cause for alarm, with  
a potential deficit of 5.2% of GDP. 

UK expenditure on manufacturing research  
and development (R&D) and capital investment 
rank poorly when compared internationally, 
indicating a reluctance to invest for long term 
growth and innovation.

  R&D is concentrated in a few UK 

manufacturing sectors and is dominated by a 
few large firms. For manufacturing as a whole, 
expenditure on R&D in the UK has been weak, 
with the UK ranking poorly compared to key 
competitors. The ratio of manufacturing R&D 
to GDP has fallen consistently since 1999.

  UK manufacturing has underperformed  

in comparison to key competitors on levels 
of capital investment. This implies that higher 
growth in total factor productivity (TFP) was 
dependent on efficiency gains, rather than on 
quality enhancing improvements, for example  
in technology.

4.1.1  
introduction

This section examines potential changes and 
uncertainties in global trade and investment which 
are relevant to how UK manufacturing will create 
and capture value in the future. Seven important 
areas are discussed in this section (see Figure 4.1). 
Changes in each, individually and collectively, will 
determine the relative importance of:

  The countries the UK exports products to, and 

imports products and other inputs from;

  The types of firms and sectors which will be 

involved in UK manufacturing trade;

  The future structure and performance of 
manufacturing within the overall balance  
of payments; 

  The place of the UK in the global pattern  

of foreign direct investment flows; and 
  The conduct of R&D and investment in 

innovation relating to trade competitiveness. 

The UK’s above-average share of Foreign Direct 
Investment (FDI) coming into Europe is at risk. 

  The UK has been a major recipient of inward 
FDI and remains in a good position to attract 
an above-average share of FDI flowing into 
Europe. However, as competition from BRIC 
and emerging economies increases, future 
FDI into Europe is likely to be a smaller share 
of global FDI flows. A decline in the share of 
manufacturing as a proportion of total inward 
FDI is likely.

Foreign-owned manufacturers in the UK will 
continue to increase.

 

If trends continue, the foreign-owned 
manufacturing sector within the UK will account 
for a larger share of output (by 2020), gross 
value added (GVA), and employment (by 2015) 
than the UK-owned sector. A larger presence 
of multi-national corporations (MNCs) could 
be associated with an improvement of the 
competitive and potential export performance 
of the UK’s largest firms, depending upon 
investment and production strategies of MNCs 
and their global value chains.

China will continue to be a global force in 
manufacturing.

  China’s growth in the recent past has been 
close to 10% per year, with Chinese GDP 
forecast to overtake the US between 2017 and 
2026. The world has not seen rapid growth 
based on a hybrid of communism and a market 
economy before, and history suggests that 
Chinese catch-up may stall before 2050.

Exports

UK exports of goods produced by the manufacturing 
sector totalled £256 billion in 2012, accounting for 
around 53% of all UK exports3. The UK is a major 
exporter of manufactured goods, and accounted  
for 2.7% of total global exports of goods in 2010 
(see Figure 4.2). This is about half the share of goods 
that were exported in 19804. The UK’s share of 
global exports of services was higher than its share 
of goods exports throughout the period 1980-2010. 
Although this share of services declined during this 
period, it was the second highest globally in 20115.

The fall in the UK’s share of goods exports has, 
nevertheless, been accompanied by an increase in 
the export intensity of the manufacturing sector. 
This is expressed as manufacturing exports as a 
proportion of manufacturing output (Figure 4.3)6. 
The share of exports, which rose from about 30% 
in 1991 to about 47% in 2011, was similar to France, 
less than Germany and higher than the US7.

4. Exposed to new market opportunities101

As a measure of the product margin, the UK 
share of world exports is relatively large for 
pharmaceuticals, chemicals, beverages and spirits, 
boilers and machinery, and the automotive sector 
(see Figure 4.4)8. A small number of products 
account for a large proportion of the value of UK 
manufacturing exports, with 10 products out of a 
total of around 4,500 accounting for over a quarter 
of the total (see Table 4.1)9. The top ten export 
products in Germany accounted for 17% of the 
total export value, compared to 20% for France and 
15% for the US in 2011. UK exports are therefore 
specialised in a small number of products. Data for 
Germany and France shows that motor vehicles and 
aeroplane manufacturing are also prominent10

To help disentangle factors affecting the falling 
share of UK manufacturing exports in global 
manufacturing exports and the rise in export 
intensity it is useful to consider which firms export, 
what they export and where they export to. Value 
of exports can be broken down into ‘firm margin’ 
(number of firms and export intensity); ‘firm-
product margin’ (number of products each firm 
sells and average export value); and ‘firm-product-
destination margin’ (number of destinations in which 
a firm sells and average export value).

Manufactured exports can be grouped according 
to the levels of technology that they embody. UK 
high and medium-high technology exports increased 
from about US$100 billion in 1990 to US$250 
billion (out of a total of US$400 billion for all UK 
manufactured exports) in 200811. The UK share  
of global high technology manufacturing exports  
is lower than Germany (4.7% compared to 7.9%)12 
but exceeds the UK average global share across 
all sectors of 2.7%. Within the EU, only Germany 
and France have a greater global share. High-tech 
manufacturing exports appear to be an area of 
comparative advantage for the UK.

As a measure of the destination margin, the UK 
exported to 226 different countries or territories 
in 2010, comparable to France (224), Germany 
(227), the United States (221) and China (208). The 
most frequent destinations have changed little over 
time. After the EU, taken as a whole, the next most 
important destination for the UK is the US, which 
accounts for 13% of the value of exports (Figure 
4.5)13, while the top 10 individual country markets 
account for 60% of exports.

Growth in UK manufacturing exports has come 
from EU countries which, taken together, accounted 
for about 54% of the total value of UK exports 
in 2012, compared to only for 8% for the BRIC

4. Exposed to new market opportunities103

In contrast, UK manufacturing firms with 250 or 
more employees are less likely to export compared 
to similar firms in France and Germany. 

Export intensity in each SME size class is slightly 
higher in the UK than in France, and for the lowest 
SME size class it is higher than in Germany (see 
Table 4.3)19. In contrast, UK firms with 250 or more 
employees are less export intensive, especially when 
compared to France. The UK export market is thus 
over-represented by small firms in terms of the 
number of exporters and the proportion of output 
they export. The size composition of UK exporting 
firms and, in particular, the under-performance of 
large firms is a likely explanation of why the UK lags 
behind Germany in terms of the overall share of 
manufacturing output that is exported.

economies (Brazil, Russia, India and China)14. For 
France and Germany, the patterns are different. The 
growth of trade to the EU started from a higher 
level and manufacturing exports are less oriented 
towards North America, and more to China and 
other BRIC economies (Figure 4.6)15.

With regard to the firm margin, the percentage 
of manufacturers exporting in the UK, France and 
Germany is about 60%, with exports accounting for 
about 30% of sales16. But as France and Germany 
have more manufacturing firms than the UK, their 
overall outputs and export shares are higher. The 
proportion of very small through to medium-sized 
enterprises17 (SMEs) that export is higher in the 
UK than France, and higher than Germany for the 
smallest firms (10-19 employees) (see Table 4.2)18.

17 The SMEs covered in these tables are those firms with between 10 and 249 employees. Data on SMEs with less than 10 employees is not available on 
a comparable basis. 18  Evidence Paper 17: Kneller, R. (2013) 19  Evidence Paper 17: Kneller, R. (2013) 

The future of manufacturing: A new era of opportunity and challenge for the UK104

For firm-product-destination margin, most UK 
firms export a small number of products to a small 
number of markets. 59% of exporters export 
between 1-4 products to between 1-4 markets. 
Only 14% of all exporters export 10 or more 
products to 10 or more markets, but they account 
for 76% of the total value of exports (see Table 
4.4)20. ’Superstar‘ exports are the dominant force in 
export performance in the UK. In contrast, German 
firms are more likely to export more products 
and to more countries than firms in France or the 
UK21. They are larger, in the aggregate, than the UK 
because the large firms export more products to 
more markets in greater volumes. 

Developing a better understanding why larger UK 
firms are less likely to export compared to German 
firms and achieve fewer and smaller export orders 
when they do is central to understanding the UK’s 
current relative performance and how it can be 
improved in the future.

Forecasts for UK manufacturing exports

Most forecasts for world GDP growth are about 
4% per year over the next decade22, although for 
the BRICs GDP is forecast to grow between 7% 
-10% per year. UK exports are likely to increase 
at a similar rate of 3-4% over the next decade. As 
exports to BRIC countries are dwarfed by exports 
to the EU (8% and 54% respectively in 201123), a 
modest growth in demand across the EU and US 
would have a larger impact on UK exports than 
growth in BRICS in the near future. 

The composition of exports may also change. 
For example, the UK’s comparative advantage 
in high-technology sectors will be a source of 
export growth in the future. However, export 
volumes in these sectors are sensitive to increases

Global Economic 
Growth and futurE 
markEts

How global economic growth performs over the next 
four decades will shape future markets worldwide. This 
section uses two scenarios to help assess the long-term 
impact of emerging economies on UK manufacturing 
exports, and the creation of future markets. 

scEnario 1: continuEd Globalisation

This scenario envisions a path of growth that is 
perhaps more volatile than that of the past 20 years, 
but ultimately leads to higher levels of economic 
integration and higher levels of income in countries 
currently designated as emerging economies. Under 
this scenario:

China, the US, India, Brazil, and Russia become 
the largest economies by 2050 (Figure 4.8)27: 
BRIC countries may contribute nearly half of the 
growth of global GDP over the next two decades, 
overtaking the US by 2015 and the G7 by 2032. 
China may overtake the US by 2026 or 201728.

in income and it is important to note that the UK 
underperforms Germany in absolute terms in the 
sense that they have bigger world export shares. 
The UK’s performance is relatively weaker in low-
tech sectors24.

The 2012 Budget outlined an ambition to double 
UK exports to £1 trillion by 2020, from £493 billion 
in 201125. The projected rate of growth of exports 
necessary to double manufacturing exports is 
significantly faster than the growth of manufacturing 
output that has been achieved over the last few 
decades. If UK manufacturing exports were to 
double by 2020 whilst output growth followed 
recent trends, the export to output ratio would rise 
to over 78% (see Figure 4.726, orange line). Germany 
currently exports 57% of manufacturing output, 
which makes the UK target to double exports, 
appear challenging.

Over the last 20 years, the ratio of exports to 
manufacturing output has on average increased by 
around 0.7% per year. Projecting this forward would 
imply an export to output ratio of 54% by 2020 
and an export value of £310 billion. Manufacturing 
exports would not double until 2032, some 12 years 
after the upper-bound forecasts, and would reach 
£800 billion by 2050 (see Figure 4.7, green line).

By 2050, the G7 countries will still be the wealthiest 
(Figure 4.10)31: At about US$78,00032 the UK 
will enjoy the third highest per capita income, 
behind the US and Canada but ahead of France, 
Germany, and Japan. Russia may top the BRIC group, 
with China and India lagging behind developed 
economies. These forecasts are supported by studies 
from HSBC (2011)33 and the Organisation for 
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 
(2012)34. For example, the OECD forecast that by 
2060, Chinese and Indian per capita income would 
reach 59% and 27% of the US level, respectively, and 
that the combined GDP of China and India will be 
larger than that of the entire OECD area.

2050 GDP per capita

A number of assumptions underpin this scenario, 
including emerging economies as a group will 
maintain strong (albeit with gradually reduced) 
growth; geopolitical events and natural disasters will 
not create significant disruption; and regional and 
international institutions continue to function. 

scEnario 2: dE-Globalisation 
The second scenario35 is characterised by a number 
of powerful global factors, including prolonged 
recession, high unemployment, climate shocks, 
conflicts over resources, public unrest, protectionist 
policies, and the unravelling of certain established 
institutions such as the EU.

 The consequences of this scenario would be weak 
economic growth around the world. While global 
de-integration would harm economies worldwide, 
regional de-integration would harm European 
countries. BRICs may also fail to reach their much-
hyped potential36. For example, in the late 1960s, 
Burma (now Myanmar), the Philippines, and Sri 
Lanka were widely anticipated to become the next 
Asian tigers, only to falter.

29 Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Korea, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Turkey, and Vietnam. 30 In the original publication, ‘larger emerging 
markets’ are labelled ‘growth markets’ and ‘smaller emerging markets’ are labelled ‘emerging markets’. To avoid confusion, all of them are labelled ‘emerging 
markets’ and are differentiated by size. 31 Goldman Sachs (2012) 32 All dollar amounts quoted in this paragraph refer to 2011 USD. 33 HSBC Business 
(2011) 34 OECD (2012b) 35 Government Office for Science (2009) 36 Sharma, R. (2012)

4. Exposed to new market opportunitiesHow are UK manufacturing exports positioned  
in the fast growing markets? 

Both scenarios envisage that emerging economies 
will grow faster than today’s mature economies 
and that competition for manufacturing exports 
will increase. UK exports to China and India of 
goods and of services have been growing rapidly, 
albeit from a low base. Between 2001-2011, UK 
exports of goods and services to China (including 
Hong Kong) and India grew at an annual average 
rate of 12.7%, compared to 4.4% to the existing 
EU37. However given that the UK is the world’s 11th 
largest goods exporter (with a 2.9% world share), 
the UK’s export performance in China, and India in 
2012 (Figure 4.11)38 remains disappointing. The UK 
needs to do better to win emerging markets for 
manufacturing exports, in these and other rapidly 
growing countries such as Russia, Brazil, Indonesia, 
and Mexico.

Emerging economies play an increasing, but still 
small, role for most EU countries including the UK 
(see Figure 4.12)39, 40. Among emerging economies, 
the biggest EU export destinations, by size, are 
Turkey, India and Brazil. On average, during 2011, 
EU countries sent 3.1% of their exports to China 
and 2.5% to Russia. The UK trails behind Germany 

107

in the majority of these fast-growing markets, with 
the exception of India, Hong Kong, Singapore, South 
Africa, and Thailand, which buy a higher percentage 
of imports from the UK than from Germany, 
evidently due to historical ties.

4.1.4 Exports,  
imports and thE 
balancE of tradE

The relative movement of both exports and 
imports is important. A divergence between 
these two aggregates will influence the balance of 
payments, and levels of wider economic activity. 
Between 1985-2011, manufacturing expenditure and 
output both increased in the UK with the former 
exceeding the latter. As a result, the UK trade 
balance deteriorated, as export performance was 
outstripped by growth in manufacturing imports, 
leading to a trade deficit of -4.1% of GDP in 2011. 
This pattern occurred in the United States, but not 
in East Asia or the Eurozone41.

It is important to consider manufacturing within 
the overall balance of payments, to understand the 
order or magnitude involved. The overall payments 
position of a country is normally measured by the 
current account. In addition to manufactured goods, 
this account includes ‘other visibles’, such as food, fuels 
and raw materials, together with ‘invisibles’, such as 
services, income from overseas investments, migrants’ 
remittances and inter-governmental transfers. 

The trade balance in manufactures has been on 
a downward trend for several decades and there 
is now a large deficit on this item. After a period 
of stability, the balance on ‘other visibles’ has 
deteriorated recently due to a combination of 
higher commodity prices and lower domestic oil 
and gas production. However, for most of the time 
these negative trends have been largely offset by 
improvements on the invisible side of the account, 
so the overall current account deficit has mostly 
been quite small for most of the time. The overall 
improvement in invisibles conceals some widely 
divergent trends, including growth in receipts from 
knowledge-based services, for example finance, 

insurance, consultancy and other business services. 
In 1991, knowledge-based services including finance 
and services generated a net income for the UK 
equal to 1.3% of GDP. By 2012, this had risen to 
5.1% of GDP. This compares to net income from 
manufacturers being -0.6% of GDP in 1991 and 
-4.2% of GDP in 201242.

It is useful to probe beyond manufacturing, taken 
as a whole, to identify relatively weak and strong 
performing industries within manufacturing in 
terms of the trade balance. Figure 4.1343 classifies 
manufacturing industries into three groups:

  Weaker industries are defined as those that 
have a negative and worsening trade balance. 
This large grouping includes clothing and leather 
where domestic producers are suffering severe 
competition from low wage imports. It also, 
however, includes electrical equipment, computer, 
electronic and optical products44. 

  Competitive industries have a positive or an 
improving trade balance. This includes coke 
and refined petroleum products, chemicals & 
pharmaceuticals, machinery and equipment, 
motor vehicles and other transport (aerospace 
and weapons)45. This corresponds closely to  
the list of top performing export sectors 
identified earlier.
Stable industries are in trade balance deficit 
but with no trend deterioration and include for 
example textiles and motor parts.

Coutts, K. (2013) 44 Some of the weaker industries’ decline may reflect the success of competition from low wage countries where firms have invested 
in technology transfer to close the gap in the frontier of technology with advanced economies (see Aghion and Howitt (2009). For other sectors the 
weakness in trade performance may reflect lack of R&D investment to compete with other advanced countries. 

4. Exposed to new market opportunities109

Predicting long run movements in the balance of 
payments is hazardous. This balance is the difference 
between two very large quantities (exports and 
imports) and small proportionate changes can 
cause the balance to swing sharply from surplus to 
deficit or vice-versa. One way to consider future 
prospects is to use projections which forecast what 
would happen under certain assumptions about 
government policy and the behaviour of economic 
variables, for example the price of oil or the 
growth of world trade. Different assumptions yield 
different forecasts. Projections rely on assessment, 
based mainly on past relationships, of the main 
macroeconomic factors such as income and relative 
prices that influence long-term trends in the balance 
of payments. Analysis starts from a base projection 
which assumes no change in government policy 
and embodies a set of assumptions about broad 
economic trends that seem reasonable in the light 
of existing evidence. It then examines how varying 
some of the assumptions would affect projected 
outcomes. Such an exercise helps to indicate the 
potential importance of various policy interventions 
to strengthen the balance of payments. 

The projections used here have a ten year horizon. 
As a starting point for the projections, the main 
items in the current account in 2012 are listed 
in Table 4.546. The category ‘other knowledge-
intensive’ services covers a variety of services for 
example communications, construction, computer 
and information services, royalties and license fees, 
consultancy, legal services, and audio-visual services. 
It excludes financial services and insurance.

In most UK manufacturing sub-sectors, imports 
and exports are increasing simultaneously, both 
absolutely and in relation to national production. 
In some cases, total exports are increasing, but 
they are being outstripped by rapidly expanding 
imports. This is most obvious in computer, electronic 
and optical products where exports rose by 
80% between 1995-2001, but imports grew by 
270%. The fact that exports are increasing in such 
apparently weak industries indicates that they retain 
competitive product subgroups. Equally, it shows the 
limitations of focusing on movements of exports 
alone in identifying comparative advantages. 

45 Motor vehicles have been separated from other activities within its sector and put it into the competitive group because it has substantially reduced 
its deficit over the past decade. The remaining component consisting of vehicle parts, trailers etc. is put into the stable group. 46 Evidence Paper 30:

The main results for the base projection for 2022 are  
as follows:

  Balance of Payments Current Account: the 
current account shown in Figure 4.1448 is in 
deficit throughout the projection period. 

  Manufactures: the deficit on manufacturing trade 
increases in monetary terms from an estimated 
£67 billion in 2012 to £85 billion in 2022. 
However, relative to the economy as a whole it 
declines from 4.4% of GDP in 2012 to 3.3% in 
2022 (see Figure 4.15)49. There is a continued 
decline in the performance of oil and gas relative 
to GDP and a continued deficit on food and 
basic materials.

Sensitivity analysis: Since the balance of trade is 
the difference between two large magnitudes, 
a proportionate error in projecting exports or 
imports may result in a larger proportionate error 
in the trade balance in manufactures. Table 4.750 lists 
a number of changes that would individually cause 
the current account balance in 2022 to deteriorate 
by 1% of GDP. If all or most of the assumptions 
shown in this figure occurred simultaneously, then 
by 2022 the UK would have a very large current 
account deficit. Conversely, if similar changes were 
to occur simultaneously in the opposite direction, 
there would be a current account surplus.

Base projection: This assumes that present trends 
continue and a strong economic recovery is 
sustained, leading to a current account deficit equal 
to 3% of GDP by 2022 (see Table 4.8)51. On the 
upside, earnings from overseas investments might 
recover or the City of London might perform better 
than the cautious assumptions imply. 

Optimistic scenario: Under these assumptions, the 
current account deficit shrinks from 4.1% of GDP in 
2012 to 0.7% in 2022 (see Table 4.8). This involves 
domestic demand increasing more slowly that the 
base projection; net investment income remaining 
in surplus; and the UK balance of trade deficit with 
regard to manufacturers decreasing faster than 
the base projection. These assumptions and the 
trajectory for the deficit are similar to forecasts 
made by the Office for Budget Responsibility in 
December 201252

Pessimistic scenario: Under these assumptions, there 
is a current account deficit equal to 5.2% of GDP 
(Table 4.8). And the balance of trade in manufacturing 
is -4.4% of the GDP compared to -3.3% under the 
base projection. This is much larger than under the 
base projection. This involves decreasing the annual 
growth rate of world trade compared to the base 

Table 4.8: Comparison of projections for the balance of payments

projection; output of oil & gas falling at a faster annual 
rate; real net exports of financial and insurance 
services growing at the same rate as under the base 
projection; and real net exports of other knowledge-
intensive services growing at a slower annual rate 
than the base projection. 

Under the pessimistic scenario, the current account 
deficit would be a cause for serious alarm, as the 
relentless deterioration in the balance of payments 
would not be sustainable. As the deficit built up, 
pressure on the exchange rate would mount, leading 
eventually to a large currency devaluation and 
domestic inflation53. The government and central 
bank might also intervene by restraining demand to 
combat inflation and limit the growth of imports. 
This combination would bring down the deficit but 
at the cost of lost output and unemployment. A key 
conclusion emerges from this analysis. This is that 
given the orders of magnitude involved, any policy 
for strengthening the balance of payments must 
assign a significant role to manufacturing. UK trade in 
manufactures (exports plus imports) is several times 
larger than exports of the City of London and other 
knowledge-intensive services put together.

Warnock (2007) find that deficit adjustment typically involves a decrease in GDP growth and may involve currency depreciation. Larger deficits take longer 
to adjust and are associated with slower output growth during current account recovery than smaller deficits. Freund, C. & Warnock, F. (2007).

4.1.5 capital  
invEstmEnt

The UK share of capital investment in output has been 
low relative to competitor economies for many decades, 
for the whole economy and for manufacturing (see 
Table 4.9). These trends are reflected in growth rates of 
the fixed capital stock, which were negative for capital 
stock growth 2000-08 (see Table 4.9)54. 

Because the UK has experienced rapid decline 
in manufacturing employment in recent decades, 
the lower capital investment is consistent with a 
better performance in growth of capital per worker 
and has been about the average of competitor 
countries. This capital deepening is not the result of 
re-allocation of resources between sectors but is 
common across sectors. There are no official current 
figures for capital per worker levels at sectoral level, 
but the McKinsey Global Institute estimates that 
there is a large gap between UK manufacturing 
in terms of the capital shortfall to match the best 
performing comparator countries55.

A major consequence of the lower growth in net 
investment and thus the capital stock is that when 
this is set against faster growth in UK manufacturing 
total factor productivity (TFP) (see Chapter 2);  
and lower growth in value-added, it implies that 
higher TFP was dependent on efficiency gains 
designed to ensure costs fell faster than the 
decline in output, rather than in quality enhancing 
improvements in technology associated more with 
new product development56.

During 1980-2009, UK manufacturing achieved 
modest output growth (0.5% p.a. on average) 
compared to 2.3% in Japan and 2.5% in the US;  
only Germany had lower overall growth in real 
value-added57. However, in the UK, this was achieved 
in quite a different way to its more successful 
competitors. Figure 4.17 helps to make this clear  
by showing that relative to the US, output in the 
UK was on average 2% p.a. lower and this was 
achieved with high TFP alongside relative cut-backs 
in both labour and capital. Compared to the US, 
manufacturing in the UK achieved what were on 
average cost-cutting efficiency gains that led to 
relatively high TFP. In the US, this TFP growth also 
went alongside significant investment in fixed capital. 

Compared to the US, both Italy and France also 
did poorly in terms of growth in output. However 
in both countries this coincided with relatively 
low gains in efficiency and/or technical progress. It 
would appear that they over-invested in their capital 
stocks, given demand for their products. Only Japan 
performed in a similar way to the US, although with 
less reliance on TFP growth and more on fixed 
capital accumulation.

During 2000-08, relative to US, manufacturing  
in the UK continued to underperform in terms of 
output growth, with again an emphasis on cost-
cutting TFP (see Figure 4.16). Germany and Japan 
both achieved higher output growth than the 
US, alongside relatively higher growth in capital 
and labour inputs (and slightly lower TFP growth). 
Italy and France achieved modest output growth 
(hence they underperformed against the US), which 
coincided with relatively higher growth of capital 
and labour inputs, but relatively poor TFP growth 
(implying few if any gains in efficiency and/or overall 
technical progress).

54 Evidence Paper 8: Driver, C. & Temple, P. (2013) 55 McKinsey Global Institute (2012) 56 On the supply-side, GVA is determined by how much capital 
and labour inputs are used to produce output, with the other major input being TFP (essentially those factors that determine the ‘efficiency’ with which

Overall, this analysis shows that UK manufacturing 
has underperformed in recent years compared to 
the US, Japan and (more recently) Germany. Despite 
strong growth in TFP, there has been a relatively 
higher shedding of labour and in particular under-
investment in the capital stock.

This implies overall efficiency gains were achieved 
alongside a lower demand for the goods and 
services produced by UK manufacturers. The 
low level of investment in capital equipment 
for expansion is mirrored by the low levels of 
investment in R&D in the UK. Both are consistent 
with a reluctance of UK firms and the capital 
markets which serve them to invest for long term 
growth and innovation58. The next section shows 
that UK manufacturing has under-invested in R&D, 
indicating a reluctance of UK firms and capital 
markets to invest for the long term.

4.1.6 invEstmEnt in 
r&d and innovation

A central factor in determining the trade and 
export performance of UK firms is their innovation 
and productivity performance. Investment in 
innovation via R&D will have a major impact on 
productivity through increasing absorptive capacity, 

and generating process and product innovations. 
Process innovation results in greater efficiency 
(as costs are lowered) while new products are 
introduced typically using better technology than 
existing products.

In the UK, R&D is heavily concentrated in a few 
manufacturing sectors and is dominated by a  
handful of the largest firms59. For manufacturing  
as a whole, expenditure on R&D in the UK has  
been relatively weak and the UK ranks at the lower 
end of the countries analysed in Figure 4.1760.  
The ratio of manufacturing R&D to GDP has fallen 
since 199961, 62.

In addition to having a relatively low commitment 
to spending on R&D, the UK is an extreme outlier 
in terms of relying on overseas funding for its R&D. 
The proportion of R&D in UK manufacturing and 
services which is funded from overseas sources 
is twice as high as the nearest country shown in 
Figure 4.1863 and about five times as high as in 
Germany (comparable data is not available for the 
United States). Overseas funding of business R&D 
is negligible in the cases of Japan and Korea. The 
UK is thus particularly vulnerable to any changes 
which might lead to a relocation of these potentially 
mobile funding sources.

58 Evidence paper 16: Hughes, A, (2013) 59 Independent SMEs employing less than 250 people accounted for less that 4% of total UK R&D spend in 
2009. Evidence Paper 16: Hughes, A. (2013) 60 Evidence paper 16: Hughes, A. (2013) 61 Because Manufacturing is more R&D intensive than the rest 
of the economy, Figure 4.17 is influenced by variations across countries in the share of manufacturing in GDP; however, Hughes (2013) shows that 
when R&D intensity (spending on R&D divided by value added in manufacturing) is compared across the same set of countries, the UK remains second 
to bottom (only above Norway). 62 Data on capital investment on fixed assets (plant, machinery, buildings, ICT, etc.) in UK manufacturing is also low 
compared to other countries as shown in Table 1 of Evidence Paper 8: Driver (2013). 63 Evidence paper 16: Hughes, A. (2013)

In addition to R&D spending being low by international 
standards, product innovation in new goods and 
services is lower in UK manufacturing (Figure 4.20)66, 67. 
In 2008, just over 13% of UK turnover was attributable 
to products which were new to the market. In 
Germany, the comparable figure was nearly double 
this amount. The UK was also significantly below the 
EU average in 2008. Other indicators of innovation 
performance are patents, trademarks, and industrial 
design rights.

The ownership characteristic of businesses carrying 
out R&D expenditure in the UK is another useful 
indicator of the internationalisation of the UK 
R&D effort. Figure 4.1964 shows that spending 
by manufacturing on R&D in 2008 was higher in 
foreign-owned firms than UK-owned and that about 
42% of the funding for UK-owned firms was from 
sources outside the UK65. This reflects the relative 
importance of inward FDI to the UK. However, 
there may be (now or in the future) issues over 
the extent to which the UK manufacturing sector 
can maintain an effective and independent research 
effort linked to the development of future goods 
and services. Overseas owned and financed R&D 
investments are likely to be subject to strategic 
relocations by the headquarters of a multinational 
company if returns to investment are not sufficient 
or it changes its strategic focus.

In 2011, services amounted to around one-
third of all global trademark applications71. UK 
manufacturing performance in this area is relatively 
weak. Applicants are over-represented in all service 
sectors (business, personal, and telecommunications 
and transport), as well as instruments and consumer 
goods. Instruments are an R&D-intensive area 
encompassing a wide range of medical and surgical 
instruments, as well as electrical and electronic 
equipment. Consumer goods are also somewhat 
innovation-intensive areas, comprising jewellery, 
clocks and watches, games and sporting equipment, 
musical instruments, firearms, and explosives72.

In the previous section, the reliance on overseas 
funding for UK R&D and the scale of R&D activity 
accounted for by overseas businesses located in 
the UK was highlighted. The pattern of overseas 
ownership of businesses in the UK more generally 
is strongly linked to the UK’s position in global flows 
of direct investment. Since 1990, the UK has been a 
major recipient of inward foreign direct investment 
(IFDI) in the form of greenfield investments, and 
mergers and acquisitions. This has led to a six fold 
increase in the UK FDI stock73. This was associated 
with a much faster growth in the stock of FDI 
relative to GDP than elsewhere in the world (see 
Figure 4.23)74.

 The majority of this investment and stock of 
assets was in services rather than manufacturing 
(see Figure 4.24)75, but it accompanied a major 
increase in the contribution of foreign firms to total 
manufacturing output which doubled between  
1998 -2008 (see Figure 4.25)76.

Based on analysis of the key determinants of FDI 
in Table 4.10, the UK remains in a relatively good 
position to continue to attract an above-average 
share of FDI coming into Europe. But FDI in Europe 
is likely to be a dwindling share of global FDI flows, 
and the UK will face growing competition from 
BRIC and other emerging economies. For example, 
while labour flexibility is an advantage for the UK 
generally, this is much less of a positive aspect 
relative to many emerging economies. Similar 
arguments apply to labour costs, corporate tax rates 
and issues of distance. As a result, it is difficult to 
envisage anything other than a continuing decline in 
the share of manufacturing as a proportion of total 
IFDI into the UK77.

the domestic economy. It is also clear that MNC 
presence is associated with superior management 
performance (Figure 4.26)79. Taken together with 
evidence in Chapter 6 on poor UK management 
practice, this suggests that an increased degree of 
openness, and MNC presence should be associated 
with an improvement of the competitive and 
potential export performance of the UK’s largest 
firms. However, there are uncertainties about the 
proportion of the profits from manufacturing that 
would remain in the UK.

UK output in foreign-owned manufacturing 
was almost as high in 2009 as in UK-owned 
manufacturing, having been almost six times smaller 
in 1973, meaning that the UK was an attractive place 
for foreign investment over the period. In 1973-
2009, the United States-owned plants in the UK 
increased their gross output by 58%. In contrast, EU-
owned plants began the period with gross output 
of £8 billion (2000 prices) and finished it with £79 
billion, signalling the importance of investment within 
the common market. 

The value of gross output produced by South East 
Asia-owned plants in the UK increased dramatically 
between 1973-2009. However, in 2008, UK-owned 
plants spent around 50% more than foreign-owned 
plants on R&D which suggests that foreign-owned 
firms tend to do much of their R&D at home rather 
than in the UK. Throughout 1997-2008, UK-owned 
plants used foreign sources to fund their R&D to a 
far greater extent than foreign-owned plants used 
UK sources to fund their R&D. It is likely that the 
foreign-owned manufacturing sector within the 
UK will soon account for a larger share of output, 
GVA and employment than the UK-owned sector. 
If the trends observed between 1973 and 2009 
continue this will occur around 2020 for gross 
output and 2015 for employment. By 2011 overseas 
owned businesses already accounted for 54% of UK 
manufacturing R&D78. 

The implications for UK exports are not clear cut. 
A high and increasing MNC presence can lead to 
a substitution of overseas production for domestic 
production at the expense of exports, when MNCs 
relocate manufacturing activity abroad, in response 
to transaction, transport, and manufacturing costs. 
This substitution effect may be offset by a positive 
effect on exports through enhanced efficiency in

4.1.9 chinEsE  
Economic Growth 
to 2050 

China accounted for less than 5% of world GDP 
in the mid-1970s (at PPP). Today this figure is 
approaching 20%. China’s growth in the recent past 
has been close to 10% per year with Chinese GDP 
forecast to overtake the United States between 
2017 and 2026. The Chinese economy has been on 
a path of rapid catch-up growth following earlier 
examples such as Western Europe and Japan after 
World War II, and the East Asian Tigers from the 
1960s but, starting from a lower level, and growing 
faster. It seems obvious to many people that growth 
will continue, with China achieving income levels 
similar to those in advanced western economies.

This is not what projections by mainstream 
economists indicate. OECD (2012) sees the 
Chinese level of real GDP per person at 55% of 
the level in the US in 2050 while the Chinese share 
of world GDP will increase to 28% by 2030 but 
flat-lines thereafter. This is based on a projected 
slowdown in real GDP growth from 8.9% per year 
in 2012-17 to 5.5% in 2018-30 and 2.8% in 2031-50, 
with two main factors expected to contribute. First, 
demographics will become much less favourable 
with labour force growth turning negative from the 
2020s and secondly, growth in labour productivity 
will slow from 9% per year currently to 3.6% in 
2031-50 (Table 4.11)80. 

This weakening of productivity growth is modelled 
as the ‘automatic’ consequence of narrowing the gap 
with the leader. In other words, productivity growth 
is seen as an inverse function of the gap between 
China and the United States which implies that it 
decreases as there is less scope for ‘catch-up’. In 
addition, the structure of the economy will become 
less industrial, which will tend anyway to reduce 
productivity growth, and more orientated to the 
service sector where convergence with the leader is 
more problematic81.

Economic history suggests that the OECD 
projections may well be too optimistic. Continuation 
of catch-up typically requires continual economic 
reform to improve institutions and policies. It is quite 
common that this process is found to be politically 
too difficult with the result that catch-up ceases as, 
for example, both Italy and Japan have found in the 
last 25 years. However, both Italy and Japan were 
much closer to US per capita GDP than China 
is forecast to be by 2050 when catch-up stalled 
so there may still be further scope for continued 
Chinese catch-up.

In this context, however, Chinese growth has been 
based on an idiosyncratic and potentially fragile 
institutional design, epitomising Gerschenkron’s 
idea82 that development from conditions of initial 
backwardness can be based on ‘substitutes for 
prerequisites’. ‘Property rights’ were protected not 
by the legal system but by incentive structures 
informing the actions of officials. The Regionally 
Decentralized Authoritarian (RDA) regime 
embodies strong competition between regions 
where success in promoting economic growth 
is rewarded by promotion for officials within 
the communist party hierarchy83. This is unlikely 
to work well if policy objectives become less 
focussed on growth as China becomes wealthier 
and would collapse if China moves towards 
democracy. Replacing the RDA regime entails a 
difficult institutional transformation but pressures 
to embrace democracy are likely to intensify with 
economic development. The world has not seen 
rapid growth based on a hybrid of communism and 
a market economy before. Nevertheless, history 
suggests that it is quite conceivable that the Chinese 
catch-up may stall before 2050.

4.2 spatial  
distribution, dE- 
industrialisation 
and rE- 
industrialisation 

kEy mEssaGEs

Global fragmentation of value chains will continue 
to be the dominant force in the spatial distribution 
of manufacturing, with onshoring bringing some 
production back to the UK:

  The future spatial distribution of 

manufacturing matters, with implications 
for employment, and regional and local 
industrial specialisation. There are prospects 
for ‘phoenix industries’ emerging in older 
industrial areas which offer advantages such as 
institutional networks and technical skills.
  Manufacturing clusters will continue to be 

important for competitiveness as they increase 
productivity and the capacity for innovation, 
and stimulate and enable new business 
formation.
Fragmentation of manufacturing value chains 
is likely to continue in the future, resulting in 
a potential spatial reconfiguration of design, 
production and assembly.

 

  Onshoring (or ‘reshoring’) is a recent trend 

occurring in the majority of developed market 
economies. It typically involves repatriation of 
production from low cost locations, investment 
in onshore production to enhance capability, 
and sourcing of components from onshore, 
rather than from overseas. Detailed evidence is 
scarce, and has led to claims that it may prove 
to be more of ‘a trickle than a ‘flood’. 
Factors driving onshoring include changing 
labour, transport and energy costs, and a need 
to be close to the market. 

 

  The future spatial distribution of manufacturing 

is also likely to be influenced by technologies 
such as additive manufacturing which allow 
production close to the point of consumption.

  The spatial distribution of manufacturing will be 
influenced by ‘the factories of the future’ which 
are likely to be increasingly diverse, distributed, 
mobile, urban and home-based. 

The UK has undergone ‘deindustrialisation’, with 
declining shares of manufacturing in employment 
and GDP, but the high-tech sector displays 
strength for the future:

  Many developed economies have experienced 

declining shares of manufacturing in employment 
and/or GDP over recent decades, with the UK 
manufacturing share of employment at 10% in 
201084 and the share of GDP at 10% in 201185. 
Against this general trend of deindustrialisation, 
the UK has had some success in its developing 
high tech sector. Its share of gross output is 
increasing and has broadly matched the decline  
in the low-tech sector share between 1973  
and 2009. 
’Business-as-usual’ projections of the structure 
of the UK economy show a continuing tendency 
to de-industrialisation, with manufacturing 
employment projected to fall between 2010  
and 2020 by anywhere from 140,000, 170,000  
or 550,000 roles. 

 

The prospect of future ‘reindustrialisation’ looks 
weak (based on current metrics) but there is 
potential for future declines in the manufacturing 
share of GDP to be at a slower pace:

 

Scenarios developed by the project consider  
if it is possible to envisage a scenario in 
which the recent declines in the share of 
manufacturing in GDP and employment could 
be reversed. 

  The answer to this is probably no, but there 
is perhaps some chance that the future rate 
of decline could be at a slower pace, with 
the most plausible scenarios producing a 
manufacturing share of GDP of either 7.3%  
or 9.7% in 2035.

The future of manufacturing: A new era of opportunity and challenge for the UK124

4.2.1 introduction

The UK manufacturing sector has been influenced 
by a number of important trends shaping its 
spatial distribution, and has experienced ongoing 
‘deindustrialisation’ in recent decades. The 
significance of these developments are discussed 
in this section, with consideration given to their 
significance for how the UK creates and captures 
value from manufacturing in the future.

4.2.2 chanGinG  
spatial distribution

This section examines trends in the geography of 
manufacturing and how it is likely to evolve in the 
future in the UK, and around the world. It discusses 
how the geography of manufacturing influences and 
is influenced by:

  The utilisation of assets and resources of local areas;
  The associated implications for local and regional 

specialisations; 

  Opportunities to capture different parts of 
the value chain with implications for regional 
competitiveness; and
Spatial variations in the quantity and quality of 
employment86, including the vulnerabilities of 
local areas to employment loss.

The spatial distribution of manufacturing in the UK

Historically, domestic industry was home-based 
and relatively widespread geographically, with many 
goods made in small workshops behind shops well 
into the 19th century. The industrial revolution, and 
particularly the development of factories, heralded 
a change in the geography of manufacturing. In the 
UK local specialisations became more apparent. At 
the outset these were closely tied to the availability 
of natural resources, such as water and coal, and 
other local assets87. 

These features help explain why the cotton industry 
became established in Lancashire and metal industries 
in the Black Country. In 1841, most districts had 
20-30% of workers employed in manufacturing. But 
in some towns dominated by single manufacturing 
industries, well over half the workforce was engaged in 
manufacturing. For example, in Oldham and Blackburn 
where textiles were predominant, over 70% of the 
workforce was employed in manufacturing and in 
the ‘Potteries’ towns of the Stoke-on-Trent area, 
62%88. Prior to 1931, the manufacturing geography 
of employment in the UK was oriented towards 
the north and midlands, although London was also 
a major manufacturing centre. From 1931 onwards, 
the growth of industries producing consumer goods 
in southern England led to a shift further south, as 
exemplified by the growth of Slough, where 53% 
of workers were in manufacturing jobs in 1971, 
compared to 13% of workers in 1881. 

In the 1970s the spatial distribution of manufacturing 
experienced a urban-rural shift89. This has been 
explained by requirements for production and 
floorspace in the context of the rising capital intensity 
of manufacturing, and also by labour requirements, 
for example a preference for non-unionised labour90. 
This led to a move away from manufacturing in urban 
centres. Regional policy also played a role here, as 
expansion in the growing regions of London became 
more difficult, and incentives for locating in other 
parts of the UK were provided. Since the 1970s, 
de-industrialisaton (see following section), has led to 
the share of total employment delcining dramatically 
with the occupational structure shifting away from 
production to professional, associate professional, and 
technical occupations (see Chapter 6). 

Yet manufacturing employment continues to display 
an uneven distribution at the sub-national scale. As 
a share of total employment, manufacturing jobs are 
concentrated in the metropolitan West Midlands, 
West Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, parts of Lancashire, 
Derby and Leicester in the East Midlands, north-
east Wales, and in and around Glasgow. Analysis 
at the regional scale in Great Britain indicates that 
in 2011, the East Midlands and West Midlands had 
the highest shares of manufacturing jobs relative 
to the average in Great Britain91. These jobs were

also highly represented in Wales and the northern 
regions of England, but virtually absent in London. 

Disaggregation by manufacturing sub-sector reveals 
local areas with high shares of spatially concentrated 
employment92. Some subsectors display a spatial 
distribution of employment which contrasts with 
the general pattern. For example, jobs in the 
manufacture of computer, electronic and optical 
products are located predominantly in the south-
east of England where shares of total employment 
in manufacturing tend to be relatively low.

These historical and contemporary trends in the 
spatial distribution of manufacturing are relevant to 
the future of the sector for a number of reasons:

 

 

 

Implications for employment: some local areas 
have proved particularly vulnerable to decline 
in manufacturing employment93 (discussed in 
Chapter 6);
Local and regional industrial specialisation: which 
can have both positive and negative effects 
(discussed below); and
Implications of evolutionary economic geography: 
including ‘path dependency’ and prospects for 
‘phoenix industries’ (outlined below). 

Local and regional industrial specialisation, and 
‘cluster policies’

Local and regional industrial specialisation can have 
both positive and negative effects94. For example, 
positive effects may include potential productivity gains, 
depending on the sub-sector, while negative effects 
might be vulnerability to sudden decline. Policies to 
promote the development of clusters often attract 
the interest of regional and local policy makers who 
seek to encourage the development of specialisms to 
accrue benefits, and resilience to negative shocks.

The idea of local concentrations of specialised 
activities yielding benefits in terms of higher 
productivity is well established. The economist Alfred 
Marshall95 noted that once established, specialised 
industrial activities can reinforce themselves by 
attracting complementary activities at various 
stages in the supply chain. They also create a pool 
of specialised labour which aids the spillover of 
knowledge between firms. 

Similar ideas have been advanced on ‘industrial 
districts’, ‘new industrial spaces’, and ‘regional 
industrial complexes’, but the term ‘cluster’, coined 
by Michael Porter, is the most prominent in the 
academic and policy debate. Porter96 attributed 
national success in competitive advantage in 
particular industries to the fact that successful 
groups of firms, together with associated businesses 
at various stages of the supply chain, form ‘clusters’. 
In these conditions high productivity is the 
outcome of four factors97: firm strategy, structure 
and rivalry; factor conditions (human resources, 
material resources, knowledge, infrastructure,); 
demand conditions; and the presence of related and 
supporting industries. Paradoxically, rivalry coupled 
with collaboration and networking between firms is 
seen as an important ingredient of success. 

The geographical concentration of clusters affects 
competitiveness by:

 

 

 

Increasing productivity: Firms can operate 
with lower levels of stock because of the local 
presence of specialised suppliers, and they 
have access to specialised skills, supported by 
specialised local training providers;
Increasing the capacity for innovation by 
facilitating interaction and the dissemination of 
knowledge. Competition between firms raises the 
incentive to innovate, which increases the capacity 
to adapt to changes and external shocks; and
Stimulating and enabling new business formation 
through spin off enterprises which face lower 
barriers to entry than in other local areas.

The idea of clusters has been influential at national 
and regional levels in the UK and many other 
countries98. Programmes to support clusters and 
regional specialisation stem from one or more 
of regional policy, science and technology policy 
and industrial or enterprise policy, and favour 
co-operative and often place-based approaches99. 
Their common aim is to improve competitiveness 
and innovation capacity. 

In England, for example, four Regional Development 
Agencies in England invested in motorsport firms in 
‘motorsport valley’, while in the north east region 
of England regional partners promoted a cluster 
on food and drink by developing and funding a

food group for the region, building supply chain 
capacity, providing start-up grants for new firms 
in the sector, addressing shortages of premises, 
supporting export initiatives, and promoting  
access to training and development.

Implications of evolutionary economic geography 
perspectives

The notion that ‘history matters’ in understanding 
processes of economic growth and their geographical 
footprint has become increasingly prominent in 
recent years. There is a widespread consensus 
that pre-existing industrial structures, institutions, 
resources, skills and experiences of places serve to 
shape the environments within which new paths 
of growth are constrained or enabled. Exponents 
of evolutionary economic geography argue that 
regional and local economic trajectories are shaped 
by historical and current circumstances100. The notion 
of ‘path dependency’ (i.e. that previous circumstances 
influence present options, even though those 
previous circumstances may no longer be relevant) is 
pertinent here. Differences in pathways for sectoral 
development, knowledge assets and local innovation 
systems will have an important influence on future 
economic trajectories101.

Thus in some circumstances, the local environment 
may constrain the development of new technologies 
and industries, as development paths become 
associated with the reinforcement of existing 
technologies and increasingly rigid ways of doing 
business. In other circumstances there may be a 
dynamic process of incremental, path-dependent 
renewal of technologies and local industries. It 
is this latter process that has enabled innovative, 
advanced manufacturing specialisms to have 
emerged ‘phoenix-like’ from the ashes of old mass 
manufacturing industries in some locations in the UK 
such as Sheffield102 (see Section 4.3.6) and in the US, 
encouraged in some instances by local sectoral policies. 

These so-called ‘phoenix industries’ benefit 
from a series of place-based initial advantages 
and capabilities, for example socio-institutional 
networks, technical skills and R&D collaborations, 
which foster processes of diversification into new 

technologies and markets103; (see Section 4.3 for 
further discussion). Often phoenix industries are 
made up of SMEs rather than large companies. They 
typically develop technologies used across a range 
of sub-sectors rather than make end products for 
one sector alone. In the future there will be more 
opportunities for the legacies of know-how, skills 
and institutions, including specialised engineering 
departments and research programmes, to help old 
manufacturing regions develop phoenix industries. 
Place-specific economic and non-economic factors, 
including history and place-associated brands, can 
play an important role in the competitive advantage 
of these new developments. 

The global geography of manufacturing and 
fragmentation of the value chain

The wider global manufacturing system104 and its 
distribution is important, and is likely to become 
more so in the future as manufacturing shifts to to 
an even more complex system of value creation.

Globalisation has played a key role in the 
distribution of manufacturing, and has driven 
two transformations or ‘unbundlings’ of the 
manufacturing sector. The first occurred when steam 
technology significantly reduced shipping costs, and 
the second began in the mid-1980s when advances 
in ICT made it possible to co-ordinate activities 
across international borders. This enabled processes 
previously performed in close geographical 
proximity to become more spatially dispersed 
leading to ‘offshoring’105, with manufacturers 
arranging for mass production activities, in particular, 
to move to low cost countries106.

Globalisation has therefore led to offshoring and the 
international fragmentation of manufacturing value 
chains, with the extent of fragmentation varying 
by subsector. Offshoring, which can also involve 
international intra-firm trade conducted primarily 
by multinational enterprises benefiting from the 
advantages of different locations, has been driven  
by diverse factors including: 

100 Boschma R.A. (2004) and Garretsen, H. and Martin, R. (2010). 101 Simmie, J., Carpenter, J., Chadwick, A. and Martin, R. (2008) 102 Christopherson, S.

4. Exposed to new market opportunities127

  Higher labour costs in developed economies have 
made it attractive for manufacturers in the UK to 
transfer production and assembly elements of the 
mass production of relatively low cost goods to 
countries with low labour costs. 

  The ICT revolution has made it easier to 
coordinate the production process across 
international borders, meaning that manufacturers 
can locate higher value-added elements of the 
manufacturing value chain in one country, and the 
lower value-added elements in another.

  The lowering of transportation costs, especially 
air freight costs and improved containerisation 
methods, has made it cheaper and faster to 
move components from one location to another. 

  Multilateral trade liberalisation has encouraged 

the fragmentation of trade across national 
borders; even a small tariff reduction can have  
a significant effect.

  Technological developments, especially those 
that enable better coordination through the 
Internet, have supported high-throughput and 
tightly coordinated manufacturing. Product-
specific technology has also allowed different 
parts of production processes to be split 
across international borders107. For example, 
the manufacture of vehicles and electronics 
has increasingly been separated into discrete 
production stages relating to components, 
assembly, testing and packaging, with different  
skill requirements, scales and inputs108. 

  Continuous improvement and integration of 

suppliers into product development processes 
has occurred through the diffusion of new ideas 
and business practices such as Just-in-Time109, 110.

  Outsourcing has also been one implication of 
fragmentation, as firms have contracted work 
to a third party to focus on their ‘core’ activities 
such as prodution. 

Fragmentation of the manufacturing value chain is a 
therefore a complex process which has been largely 
confined to mass production of relatively low cost 
goods. In the case of supply-chains for intermediate 
goods (i.e., importing and exporting of intermediate 

and unfinished manufacturing goods) most nations 
are largely self-sufficient111, For example, in 2009, a 
sample of 40 economies showed that local sourcing 
was above 50% and in many instances, above 70%. 
Trade in final goods currently far exceeds trade in 
intermediate goods. For example, in 2009, 44% of 
manufactured final goods were exported compared 
to only 27% of manufactured intermediate goods. 

It appears likely, therefore, is that globalisation and 
the ‘second unbundling’ may still develop much 
further112, with fragmentation of the value chain 
likely to continue in the future. This will offer 
potential for the spatial reconfiguration of design, 
production and assembly and a reassertion of the 
importance of place.

Focus on onshoring

In recent decades, the global geography of 
manufacturing has shifted away from many locations 
with high labour costs as companies focussed on 
cost control and searched for locations which 
provided them with location-specific advantages113, 114. 
The rise of Asia Pacific as an important manufacturing 
location has been enabled by advantages in factor 
conditions. However, many of these advantages are 
now being challenged by wage inflation and the 
emergence of a large internal consumer market. 
Economic changes in countries in this region for 
example China, India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam 
coupled with volatility in energy prices have the 
potential to change the geography of global 
manufacturing in the decades ahead.

A relatively new trend that could gather pace is the 
‘onshoring’ (or ‘reshoring’) of production activities 
back to developed market economies. It typically 
involves repatriation of production from low cost 
locations, investment in onshore production to 
enhance capability, and sourcing of components 
from onshore, rather than from overseas. Onshoring 
is likely to be driven in the future by a number of 
factors115, 116, with the relative importance of each 
of these varying by activity and technology117 (see 
Table 4.12). These factors suggest that it is becoming 
possible for the UK to compete with lower cost 

107 Yamashita, N. (2010) p.8 108 In contrast, the continuous production process of some industries, for example the chemical industry creates technical 
difficulties in separating production into discrete steps. 109 The quality of leadership and management practices are also important here (see Chapter 
4). 110 Evidence Paper 21: McLaughlin, P. (2013) 111 Baldwin, R. & Lopez-Gonzalez, J. (2013) 112 Baldwin and Lopez-Gonzalez (2013, Table 2) show 
that manufactured exports in 2009 comprised $3.4 trillion of final goods and $4.8 trillion of intermediate goods (almost 60% of manufactured exports 
comprised intermediates rather than final goods). But since manufacturing is dominated by the production of intermediate goods, most intermediate 
production ($17.9 trillion in 2009) stays within domestic borders, while approaching half of the $7.8 trillion of manufactured final goods is exported, so 
there is scope for further unbundling of supply-chains leading to a higher level of exports for intermediates. 113 Vernon. R, (1966) 114 Dunning. J. (2001)

locations on quality, delivery speed, customisation 
and sometimes price. 

Detailed evidence on onshoring is scarce, and has 
led to claims that it may prove to be a relatively 
minor process, and more of ‘a trickle than a flood’120. 
However, there is recognition that onshoring is 
occurring in the majority of developed market 
economies in transportation goods, computers and 
electronics, fabricated metal products, machinery, 
plastics and rubber, appliances and electrical 
equipment, furniture, ceramics and textiles121. 
Low volume products, for example automotive 

and aerospace parts, appliances and construction 
equipment in which labour accounts for a minor 
proportion of total costs, are considered the most 
suitable for onshoring. 

A 2009 survey of 300 UK based manufacturing 
firms also revealed that 14% of firms had brought 
production back to the UK from other countries 
over the past two years122. In the US a small 
but growing number of firms are repatriating 
production, including General Electric, NCR and 
Caterpillar123. Recent examples of UK onshoring are 
provided in Box 4.1.

emphasised its commitment to increasing sales of 
products manufactured in the UK by announcing 
a two-year 15 per cent growth target for all sales 
of goods in its shops that are made in the UK. In 
addition, it has increased its number of UK suppliers 
from 132 in 2012 to 207 in 2013. 

Hornby plc: In November 2012 the UK model

ensure high quality standards continue to be met, 
but from an easier location nearer to the Margate 
Head Office125. 

Laxtons Ltd: This spinning company, established in 1907, 
is now a design-driven yarn manufacturer. Like nearly 
all British textile companies production was offshored, 
but it has now returned to Yorkshire, reducing the 
firm’s carbon footprint and lead times and increasing its 
control over quality and raw materials126

Bathrooms.com: During July 2013127 the online

manufacturers to UK businesses in the Midlands, 
to decrease the time taken from design through to 
production from four to six months to six weeks.

retailer launched its Best of British collection selling 
womenswear and menswear collections which 
emphasise British craftsmanship and quality, which 
feature a combination of British heritage, sourcing 
and production, as part of a three-year deal with the 
British Fashion Council to support domestic talent 
and increase its sourcing from the UK.

The future geography of manufacturing

Looking out to 2050, the geography of 
manufacturing will be influenced by a range of 
drivers129 with the importance of each varying 
between industries. They include changes in the 
importance of different factors of production 
including capital and labour; labour costs; transport 
costs; energy costs; changes in the relative (dis)
advantages of co-location of manufacturing tasks 
and activities; skills availability; changing technologies, 
and changes in consumer preferences and demands. 

Additive manufacturing (see Chapter 3) is likely 
to play an increasingly important role by allowing 
customised parts to be produced close to the 
point of consumption, making manufacturing more 
distributed as an activity. Movement towards the 
point of consumption suggests a revival of more 
local ‘distributed’ manufacturing, and of urban 
manufacturing. Environmental developments 
will mean that manufacturing will be more of a 
‘good’, as opposed to a ‘bad’ neighbour. The spatial 
distribution of manufacturing may become more 
even as a result of these trends. Chapter 3 provides 
a fuller discussion on the factories of the future, 
and concludes that they are likely to become more 
diverse, more distributed, more mobile, more urban 
and more home-based. The spatial distribution of 
manufacturing in the UK will clearly be influenced  
by these developments. 

4.2.3 dE- 
industrialisation

‘De-industrialisation’ refers to declining shares of 
manufacturing in employment and/or GDP.  These 
trends are apparent in many developed economies, 
including the countries shown in Table 4.13, over  
the past 40 years, with pronounced declines seen  
in the UK.

The decline in the share of GDP has resulted from slower 
growth in the volume of output in the manufacturing 
sector compared with the whole economy, and from price 
falls relative to services where productivity growth has 
been faster. The share of employment in manufacturing 
in the UK stabilised at around 10% in 2010130, with the 
decline caused by sources including:

  The relatively strong growth in domestic demand

for services as incomes increase;

  The relatively faster growth in domestic labour 

productivity in services; and

  The greater labour intensity of imports 
compared with exports meaning that an 
expansion of trade also reduces manufacturing 
employment in developed economies. 

Analysis of the decrease in employment in 
manufacturing within developed economies (see 
Table 4.14)131 shows that internal factors related 
to the process of economic growth have a larger 
impact than the trade effects, though trade growth 
has clearly been de-industrialising. However, the 
large residual for the UK indicates that not all of its 
deindustrialisation can be fully explained although 
trade effects may have been underestimated132.

Against this general trend of deindustrialisation, the UK 
has had some success in its developing high tech sector 
(see Table 4.15)132. The share of high-tech sectors in gross 
output has increased and has more or less matched the 
decline in the low-tech sectors’ share. However, faster 
productivity growth in high-tech sectors means that 
employment shares in these sectors in 2009 were not 
very different from 1973.

suggest that the trade effect is probably greater than the estimated equation, which implies and that at least two points of the residual is attributable to 
this. In a subsequent analysis, they conclude that it is especially the deterioration in manufacturing trade balance from +4.8% of GDP in 1970 to -4.4% 
of GDP in 2010 which accounts for the greater extent of deindustrialisation in the UK compared with other European countries. Two possibly related 
factors that have affected the manufacturing trade balance are the strength of the UK’s position in international trade in services and trends in relative

share of GDP in 2035 has fallen to 7.3 per cent134. 
If this scenario is modified by assuming that an 
‘improved manufacturing trade balance’ with the 
manufacturing trade deficit eliminated by 2035, then 
deindustrialisation would continue but at a much 
slower pace such that manufacturing’s share of GDP 
would be 9.7 per cent in 2035. 

In the ‘super optimistic’ scenario, manufacturing 
trade is in surplus in 2035. The assumption of a 
surplus equal to 2% of GDP is probably at the 
upper end of what is feasible given the UK’s strength 
in services trade. Here, a better trade performance 
can be thought of as necessary but not sufficient to 
reverse deindustrialisation and the internal growth 
contribution to deindustrialisation has to be diluted, 
for example by assuming that relative manufacturing 
prices fall less rapidly in future. The combination of 
assumptions required to deliver even this modest 
increase over 2010 in manufacturing’s share, to 11.8 
per cent in 2035, is improbable135.

Is it possible to envisage a scenario in which the 
recent declines in the share of manufacturing in 
GDP and employment are reversed? The answer 
to this is probably no but there is perhaps some 
chance that the future rate of decline could be at 
a slower pace. Three different scenarios looking 
forward 25 years from 2010 explore this question 
(see Table 4.16, and Figure 4.27)133. It is important 
to emphasise that these scenarios focus on the 
performance of manufacturing as it is measured 
(output from production), as opposed to any wider 
value chain activity. 

Under ‘business-as-usual’ it is assumed that the 
manufacturing trade balance remains in deficit to 
the same extent as in 2010 and that the internal 
growth contribution to deindustrialisation follows 
the trend of the last 40 years driven by increasing 
incomes and changes in relative prices. Under this 
scenario, manufacturing continues to decline and its

projections embody rather different assumptions about future labour productivity growth in manufacturing but, even so, the various authors are agreed 
that, under almost any scenario, there is unlikely to be a significant increase in the employment share of manufacturing.

Several factors will play an important role in 
the long-run global competitiveness of the UK 
manufacturing sector, particularly as manufacturing 
continues to evolve, as outlined in Chapter 2. 
There are seven factors which will be particularly 
critical to competitiveness in future manufacturing:

  The control of manufacturing value chains, 

linked to new business models;

  The importance of co-location and maintaining 

an ‘industrial commons’;

  The emergence of manufacturing services;
  Access to future markets for goods and 
services, and maximising the benefits of  
inward investment;
Support for ‘phoenix’ industries building on 
older capabilities;

 

  The role of ‘infrastructure’ (including the 
physical landscape & long-term financing);

4. Exposed to new market opportunities 

Facilitation of the future commercialisation of 
technology and support for innovation;
  The importance of highly skilled ‘hybrid’ 

workers (see Chapter 6); and

  The importance of energy needs for 

manufacturing (see Chapter 5).

4.3.1 introduction

Diverse, economic, technological, environmental, 
and sociological changes will determine the long-
run competitiveness of the UK manufacturing 
sector, and therefore the long-run growth of the UK 
economy. This section discusses the role of seven 
particularly important factors listed above136, and 
their implications for policy, with several concerning 
the globalisation of value creation involving trade137. 

4.3.2 thE control 
of manufacturinG 
valuE chains138

As outlined earlier, it is likely that globalisation and 
the ‘second unbundling’ may still develop much 
further, with fragmentation of the value chain likely 
to continue in the future. The interplay between 
future developments in information and coordination 
technologies, changes in transportation costs, and 
differences in labour costs between nations will all 
influence the future structure of international value 
and supply chains (see Figure 4.28)139.

Trade &

Rapid improvements in coordination and communication 
technology, for example advances in telepresence 
technology and workflow organisation, will allow further 
fragmentation of supply chains, both functionally and 
geographically, and create more complexity. The major 
influences which may drive a trend to less global and 
more regional supply chains include:

  The impact of increases in oil prices on 

transportation costs;

  The emergence of additive manufacturing 

technology, which is likely to reduce the 
importance of economies of scale as a factor in 
the location of some types of manufacturing140 
and allow for production to be located in 
a greater diversity of locations, from small 

136 The last two are considered separately in Chapters 5 and 6. 137 Baldwin, R. & Evenett, S.J. (2012a) 138 Discussion in this Section focuses on 
manufacturing value chains (see Chapter 2) including supporting supply chains and distribution networks. 139 Baldwin, R. (2012b) 140 Evidence Paper 17:

reconfigurable local units to capital intensive 
super factories (see Chapter 3). This shift would 
produce a different geography of production141. 

  The potential role of onshoring, as discussed 
earlier in this chapter142, which may result in 
stronger regional value chains within Europe. 
However, 143 suggests that so-called globalised 
trade is already heavily segmented into three 
regional blocks, Europe with Germany at its  
hub, North East Asia dominated by Japan,  
and the third in North America with the US  
as the ‘headquarter’ nation.

These possible developments do not reduce the 
significance of fragmentation, but highlight the 
potential for the UK to (re)locate production and 
assembly closer to other activities. The weight of the 
evidence and analysis suggests a continued, likely 
and significant growth in the internationalisation 
of supply-chains. This conclusion agrees with 
expert views144 that a critical element of future 
competitiveness will be an ability to create and then 
operate international manufacturing value chains: 

‘It is seen as very important that businesses have the 
skills and capabilities to create the value chain as an 
integrated system – the key step – and to operate 
it. Operation of the value chain, essentially the 
co-ordination of supply chain members to operate 
a cross-organisational business process, is seen as 
complex but less challenging than creating it. Lean 
supply chains balancing global and local are a given 
but lean must be exquisitely balanced with resilience. 
Materials management and resource conservation is 
also critical’ Ridgeway, K. et al. (2013)145.

This emphasis on value chain creation and 
operation is linked with the development of new 
business models (see Chapter 2). These models 
recognise that goods and services have become 
more complex because of technological and 
other developments. They in turn will increasingly 
exploit technological developments to capture new 
sources of value. For example, manufacturers will 
be able to identify and characterise people, places, 
and organisations in more detail, resulting in new 
information, new relationships and hence new ways 
of creating value such as making products more 
personalised146 (see Chapter 3). Products are also 
likely to generate data relating to usage, and allow 
firms to exploit this new information. 

advicE for policy-makErs:

Government needs to be at the forefront of 
understanding the evolution of manufacturing 
business models, and how manufacturers can 
be supported to take advantage of expanding 
international manufacturing value-chains. 
Government has a role to play as a: 

  Champion of best-practice, working to 

 

disseminate and coordinate through industrial 
partner organisations. 
Facilitator, helping manufacturers to adapt 
through integrated and adequately resourced 
policies across different domains including 
regulatory, skills and education, technology, 
international trade, and industrial policies.

Businesses will need to have strong managerial 
capabilities and leadership to provide the  
knowledge and skills to create value chains as  
an integrated system. 

4.3.3  
thE importancE 
co-location and 
‘industrial  
commons’

As discussed in Chapter 2, manufacturing was 
previously understood to be the production 
process, which could be divided from the other 
parts of the value-chain, and located in the lowest 
cost location. It is now increasingly recognised  
that manufacturing encompasses the whole of the 
value-chain including production, research, design, 
and elements of service provision, in which the 
role of knowledge is likely to become even more 
significant. This broader approach in turn raises 
issues of co-location of activities, and how and  
when they affect value creation. 

The concept of the ‘industrial commons’ defined 
below, points to the interrelatedness of activities in 
the manufacturing value chain, and argues that their 
co-location is important for growth and innovation. 

141 Evidence paper 3: Bryson, J. et al. (2013) 142 Evidence paper 3: Bryson, J. et al. (2013) 143 Baldwin, R. & Lopez-Gonzalez, J. (2013) 144 Evidence 
Paper 29: Ridgeway, K. et al. (2013) 145 Evidence Paper 29: Ridgeway, K. et al. (2013) 146 Evidence Paper 33: Spring, M. (2013) 

4. Exposed to new market opportunities135

The ‘industrial commons’ : ’… the R&D and 
manufacturing infrastructure, know-how, process-
development skills, and engineering capabilities 
residing in firms, universities, and other organisations 
that provide the foundation for growth and 
innovation in a wide range of industries’147. 

The notion of benefits and spillovers from co-location 
have been debated for many years148, The discussion 
here concerns the process of innovation and how  
it works. The emphasis is on the spatial link between 
R&D, more generally, and manufacturing. 

Innovation concerns the movement of ideas from 
the conceptual stage into the customer’s hands. For 
some highly complex products, for example flat panel 
displays, photovoltaic cells, and biotechnology drugs, 
the transfer from R&D into production is a messy 
and non-linear affair, requiring tight coordination 
and a transfer of learning between designers 
and ‘producers’. If R&D operations have a poor 
understanding of the production environment, then 
design of the product may well be more difficult149.

Hence, companies that spatially separate the location 
of different parts of the value chain (for example, 
Apple products are typically ‘designed in California’ 
and ‘assembled in China’) risk loosening the transfer 
of tacit knowledge between different parts of the 
business. Competitive advantages may be lost unless 
the research, design and development of the product 
is also offshored closer to the production hub, or 
production is onshored. It is not only the company 
itself that might suffer: there are wider implications 
for specialist suppliers located in the original ‘industrial 
commons’. As Pisano and Shih observe:

“As capabilities erode, it is harder for companies 
that require access [to the ‘industrial commons’] 
to stay in business. They are forced to move their 
operations or their supplier base to the new 
commons. As they move, it is harder for existing 
suppliers to sustain themselves. Ultimately, they must 
either close shop or move their operations”150. 

The unravelling of the commons is therefore 
potentially a vicious circle, as it becomes increasingly 
difficult for suppliers to justify investing in new 
technologies or training workers. This lack of 
investment leads to further erosion in competitive 
performance, which makes it more attractive for 
other companies to move supply bases overseas151.

The need for co-location of research, development, 
design and depends on the degree of modularity 
(the extent to which a system’s components can be 
separated) and the maturity of the manufacturing 
process technology152. As shown in Figure 4.29, only 
when both modularity and process maturity are 
high (the top right-hand quadrant) does separation 
not lead to any loss of competitiveness. The design 
and production of Apples’ iPad is illustrative. Pisano 
and Shih again:

“… It falls into the pure-product-innovation 
quadrant, which explains why the product could be 
designed in California while many of its components 
are designed and produced in Asia, where final 
assembly occurs. A number of components (e.g., 
lithium ion batteries and the touchscreen) fall into 
different quadrants, where it’s important for R&D 
and manufacturing to be located near each other. 
The location of those R&D and manufacturing 
capabilities in other countries means that for the 
future products that need those capabilities will 
come from those countries, too”153.

Research on UK manufacturing has identified the 
importance of the co-location of design, research  
and development services within manufacturing. Over 
half of UK firms surveyed in 2007 considered it very 
important to co-locate production together with 
design and development154. In the US, the geography 
of industrial design tends to mirror that of production. 
For example, over 60% of the design consultancies in 
the Los Angeles area are focused on electronics or 
aerospace markets, 76% of Detroit’s design companies 
serve the automotive or machinery sectors, and half of 
San Francisco’s design companies cater to clients in the 
aerospace industries155.

147 Pisano, G. & Shih, W. (2012). 148 This importance of ‘place’ has gained renewed impact since the development of the ‘New Economic Geography’ 
(see, for example, the discussion in Harris, R. (2011) ‘Models of Regional Growth: Past, Present and Future’ [Academic paper] Journal of Economic Surveys, 
vol. 25(5), pp. 913-951) 149 Pisano, G. & Shih, W. (2012). p.15 150 Pisano, G. & Shih, W. (2012). p.16 151 Pisano, G. & Shih, W. (2012). p.17 152 Pisano, G. &

PROCESS-EMBEDDE D INNOVATION 
Process technologies, though mature, are still 
highly integral to product innovation. Subtle 
changes in process can alter the product’s 
characteristics in unpredictable ways. Design 
cannot be separated from manufacturing.
Examples: Craft products, high-end wine, 
high-end apparel, heat-treated metal 
fabrication, advanced materials fabrication, 
specialty chemicals.

PROCESS-DRIVEN INNOVATION
Major process innovations are evolving 
rapidly and can have a huge impact on 
the product. The value of integrating R&D 
and manufacturing is extremely
high. The risks of separating design and 
manufacturing are enormous. 
Examples: Biotech drugs, nanomaterials, 
OLED and electrophoretic displays, 
superminiaturized assembly.

PURE PRODUCT INNOVATION
The processes are mature, and the 
value of integrating product design 
with manufacturing is low. Outsourcing 
manufacturing makes sense. 
Examples: Desktop computers, consumer 
electronics, active pharmaceutical ingredients, 
commodity semiconductors.

PURE PROCESS INNOVATION
Process technology is evolving rapidly but 
is not intimately connected to product 
innovation. Locating design near 
manufacturing isn’t critical. 
Examples: Advanced semiconductors, 
high-density flexible circuits.

 Co-location and the concept of the industrial commons 
clearly have substantial policy implications for the  
future of manufacturing in the UK. There is a critical 
strategic role for government in helping to develop  
and maintain existing design and R&D clusters, stimulate 
the creation of new clusters, and encourage the  
co-location of manufacturing activities. This is important 
given the role of collaboration between firms in future 
business models (see Chapter 2). There is also a role 
for ‘collaborative communities’ of individuals, firms, and 
governments who have capabilities and infrastructure 
which facilitate collaboration, and shared access to the 
industrial commons’156. 

advicE for policy-makErs:
The ‘industrial commons’, i.e. the interrelatedness 
of the various parts of the manufacturing value 
chain from R&D through production to disposal 
and recycling, is clearly important to the UK’s 
international manufacturing competitiveness, and 
critical in keeping specific manufacturing activities 
located in the UK. There is a need to ensure that 
industrial strategy across and between all relevant 
stages of the manufacturing value chain works to 
strengthen appropriate clustering and co-location, 
taking into account the specific context of the UK.

The emergence of manufacturing services, which act 
to complement and enhance products and create 
additional or new revenue for manufacturers, is likely 
to be one stage in a much more complex process 
which involves the hybridisation of manufacturing 
and services to produce hybrid products157. These 
products involve adding post-production services to 
the product, and provide their producers with the 
opportunity to obtain profit from developing and 
exploiting assets. This ‘capture’ of profit is based on 
the opportunity to sell additional service contracts, 
to persuade existing customers to upgrade, to co-
innovate with strategic customers, to sell existing or 
new services and also to provide spare parts158. 

The incorporation of services into manufacturing 
and the move towards hybrid products requires 
firms to have the necessary (intangible) assets, 
capabilities, and business models. The risk of investing 
in specific assets and capabilities inevitably involves 
some degree of technological lock-in. However, that 
risk is unavoidable if firms are to be able to exploit 
potential opportunities in providing services.

advicE for policy makErs:
There is an opportunity for government to help 
manufacturing firms to increase their ability to 
create new and additional revenue streams through 
manufacturing services by identifying and sharing 
examples of UK and international ‘best practice’, and 
by strengthening UK manufacturing leadership and 
management capacity to help manufacturers adapt.

The UK is the 10th largest exporter of goods 
globally,159 however its global market share in 
terms of the export of manufactured goods 
declined from 7.2% in 1980 to 2.9% in 2012160. 
Part of this decline can be explained by the rapid 
opening-up of countries such as China and other 
emerging economies to international trade, and the 
subsequent catch-up of these economies. Falling 
export shares also occurred in France and Japan, 
although they were constant or rising in Germany 
and the U.S.

Falling export shares are almost inevitable, given 
developments in emerging economies, but this 
does not necessarily imply falling export values. 
Rapid growth in world trade in recent decades 
and associated growth in supply chains provided 
an opportunity for increases in the overall value of 
UK exports. But while there has been an increase, 
this has not been strong relative to the UK’s major 
competitors, including France and Germany161. So 
there are other reasons why the UK has been losing 
its export market share over and above the strong 
performance of countries like China, India and Brazil. 

The explanation behind the UK’s underperformance 
relative to two of its competitors, France and 
Germany, is to be found in the relatively smaller 
size of the manufacturing sector in the UK and 
the relative underperformance of large UK 
exporters compared to other countries, especially 
Germany. In terms of the size of the sector, the 
overall percentage of manufacturing firms engaged 
in exporting (the extensive margin) and the 
percentage of total output that is exported (the 
intensive margin) are similar across these three 
countries. But France and Germany have more 
manufacturing firms than the UK. So while the 
propensity to export does not differ significantly,  
the UK has fewer firms available for exporting. 

157 Evidence Paper 3: Bryson, J. et al. (2013) 158 Evidence Paper 3: Bryson, J. et al. (2013) 159 Evidence Paper 17: Kneller, R. (2013) 160 World Trade 
Organisation (2013). 161 These figures are based on manufacturing export data available from the UN Comtrade Yearbook for 2011 Table I  
(http://comtrade.un.org/pb/FileFetch.aspx?docID=4772&type=World%20Tables%20-%20Vol%20II.) 

The future of manufacturing: A new era of opportunity and challenge for the UK138

When the data on exporting are considered by 
firm-size, another more important difference 
emerges. Fewer UK large firms (i.e. with more than 
250 employees) export, and those that do export 
a smaller proportion of output relative to large 
German firms162. Around 81% of UK firms with 
more than 249 employees export, whereas the 
figure is 88% in France and 84% in Germany. (see 
Chapter 4 for further discussion).

The UK export market is over-represented by small 
firms both in terms of the number of exporters, and 
the proportion of output they export, while large 
firms are under-represented. Given that smaller 
firms produce lower quantities than larger firms, the 
value of exports created by the additional smaller 
firms is not sufficient to compensate for the value  
of exports foregone by larger firms who do not.  
A more detailed analysis of the relative difference  
in exporting performance of the largest firms shows 
that the UK and France are fairly similar with both 
having a much smaller proportion of large ‘exporting 
superstars’ compared to Germany (see Box 4.2). 

box 4.2: ExportinG by firm sizE in  
thE uk, francE and GErmany163
In all countries, the majority of firms export a small 
number of products to a small number of markets. In 
2010, 14% of all UK exporters exported 10 or more 
products to 10 or more markets, but they accounted 
for 89% of the total value of UK goods exports. These 
are the ‘exporting superstars’. In fact in 2010 just 1% 
of UK firms accounted for 70% of total export value 
with the top 5% accounting for 90%. For France, firms 
who export more than 10 products and to more 
than 10 destinations again represent only 11% of all 
exporters, but they account for 76% of the value of 
exports. But in Germany 39% of exporting firms sell 
10+ products to 10+ destinations, accounting for 
91% of the total value of exports. It seems reasonable 
to conclude from this evidence that this difference 
explains the export gap between Germany with 
France and the UK. 

These exporting superstars are very likely to be 
multinational corporations (see Chapter 4) that 
rely heavily on FDI and/or international outsourcing. 
The former involves operating affiliates overseas 
while the latter does not necessarily involve owning 
firms in the supply chain. The evidence for this 
characterisation is that 38% of German firms with 
250+ employees are involved in FDI or international 
outsourcing compared to 23% for the UK164. 

The conclusion is therefore that once the smaller 
size of the UK manufacturing sector is taken 
into account, on most measures it performs 
similarly to France. The exceptional performer is 
Germany, where this difference is explained by the 
performance of its large firms and greater number 
of export superstars165. Box 4.3 summarises some 
of the key features of German manufacturing, which 
help to explain its strong performance.

Finance: A key point of contrast with the UK in the German ‘stakeholder’ system of industrial finance for larger 
firms is the role of the hausbank, the primary long-term relationship banker to a business, with equity finance 
playing a more limited role than in the UK. It is not the prominence of bank finance alone that provides a 
contrast, but also the character of the relationship. German manufacturers have access to bank finance not 
typically provided on the basis of publicly available data or current returns. The relationship hinges on a two-
way exchange of information between banks and firms and the hausbank may simultaneously lend money to a 
firm, own shares, have seats on its board and vote at shareholders’ meetings. Small and medium sized firms, the 
so-called Mittelstand, have access to finance through a system based on local savings banks (Sparkassen) which 
provide about two-thirds of all lending to Mittelstand companies along with co-operative banks.

Firm coordination and innovation strategies: German manufacturers excel in the production of sophisticated 
engineering products requiring deployment of long-term, patient capital and a highly skilled labour force. Firms 
tend to specialise in established but complex production processes relating to machine tools, engines, consumer 
‘white goods’, cars and materials processing, complemented with after-sales service and long-term customer 
relationships. Incremental innovation is defined as ‘competence-preserving’, with the product line improved 
rather than rendered obsolete as new market opportunities are explored. It is important for maintaining 
competitiveness in the production of capital goods where the challenge is to maintain a high quality established 
product line while devising improvements to maintain quality and hold down costs. Incremental innovation is 
often contrasted with ‘radical’ innovation pursued by many British firms, particularly in hi-technology sectors. 
Radical innovation is ‘competence-destroying’, in that firms may innovate themselves out of previous tasks to 
seek out new product niches. But Germany outperforms the UK in both novel or radical innovation as well as 
incremental innovation with the latter is often central to full exploitation of the former167.

Institutional complementarity: Germany’s manufacturing institutional make-up, based on sophisticated skills, 
patient capital, dense inter-firm networks, leading to the production of complex medium technology capital and 
consumer goods, could be construed as a ‘comparative institutional advantage’. Its success is the result of these 
interactions between different sub-systems, all guided by the same institutional principles, which allow them to 
move in tandem.

One area where the UK may be able to develop 
a comparative advantage in the future is in the 
exporting of services, which increased as a 
percentage of UK total final demand from 6.3% 
in 1997 to nearly 9.4% by 2010168. Currently, this 
advantage does not extend to services linked to UK 
manufacturing exports169. Given earlier arguments 
above about the importance of servitisation in 
manufacturing, this is likely to be a factor that can 
drive competitiveness and manufacturing export 
performance in the future. 

There has been significant growth in world trade 
in recent decades (see Chapter 4). However, UK 
exports to economies predicted to be in the top 
30 by 2050 including the BRIC countries and some 

of the ‘Next 11’170 are a very small share of the 
total value of UK exports (2.6% in 2010171). Even 
rapid growth in demand for UK exports from 
these countries in the future is only likely to have a 
modest effect on the total value of UK exports172. 

Relative export performance is determined by  
the competitiveness of UK products, which in  
turn is dependent on productivity and innovation 
(linked with quality), value for money, and delivery 
to specification. These emerged as key criteria in  
a survey of customers in China, India, and the US173. 
Products from the U.S. were perceived as strong  
in innovation, and those from Germany and Japan  
as competitive in value for money, quality, and 
delivery. Exports from the UK are typically viewed as

weaker in terms of these criteria, with exports  
from France viewed as weaker still. Overall, US 
customers have the most positive perceptions  
of UK exports, with Chinese customers the least 
positive and Indian customers slightly more  
positive  than Chinese customers. 

advicE for policy-makErs:
There is a need to understand what prevents the 
UK from having more exporting ‘superstars’. 

Exporting, generally, is undertaken by firms with 
relatively higher levels of productivity (i.e., those that 
focus on value, rarity, and hard to imitate resources 
and capabilities174). Therefore policies that impact 
on productivity levels, for example by raising the 
quality of leadership and management, will be key. 
This is in addition to the traditional role of UK Trade 
& Investment that facilitates exporting through 
providing advice and market-based intelligence to 
companies looking to export (more), and support 
to businesses once they are operating in a market, 
for example in the areas of language and culture.

There are also more fundamental questions relating 
to how firms obtain finance (for investment in R&D, 
exporting and growth activities more generally), 
the role of ‘patient capital’, and institutional 
complementarity (see Section 4.3.7). 

4.3.6   support  
for ‘phoEnix’  
industriEs  
buildinG on oldEr 
capabilitiEs

A recent analysis of US manufacturing argues that 
in order to understand where the potential for 
expansion of US manufacturing is greatest, there is a 
need to examine original ‘manufacturing strongholds’ 
to focus on rebuilding regional strengths175. These 
strongholds include remnants of supply chains, and 
specialised knowledge in regional labour markets.

This has given rise to the idea of ‘phoenix 
industries’. These are firms that benefit from pre-
existing personal networks, technical skills, and 
market knowledge which have developed over 
a long period176. This argument is based around 
the strategic assets that old industrial regions 
still possess including specialised engineering 
departments and research programmes. There are 
strong parallels with the idea of there being ‘regional 
innovation systems’177. 

Phoenix industries, particularly as they exist in the 
U.S., are considered to be very different to old 
manufacturing industries. They consist of many small 
and medium-sized firms and rarely make complete 
products, but specialise in the production of high-
value sophisticated components which are sold to 
equipment manufacturers178. As a consequence, 
regions with strong research universities but 
without dynamic small firm networks frequently 
find those innovations commercialised elsewhere. 
Essentially the regional economy lacks the ability 
to absorb product and process innovations. For 
newer regional economies without established 
manufacturing capacity, investment in university-
based high-tech research may have little impact 
on localised manufacturing179. 

This issue is important for the UK where historically, 
R&D has been concentrated within a few 
universities and there have not been strong links 
between them and industry. There is some evidence 
of infrastructure for phoenix industries developing 
in the UK with the recent introduction of specialised 
training and research programmes by Sheffield 
University. As the Sheffield Initiative demonstrates, 
a university programme can act as an intermediary 
between industries developing from small-medium 
enterprises by advising policy-makers and the public 
of the advantages of advanced manufacturing, 
providing technical assistance and access to new 
technology, and fostering internships between 
graduates and local companies180.

advicE for policy-makErs:
Industrial policies focussed on strengthening 
the manufacturing sector need to recognise the 
importance of place, with resources and assets of 
local areas utilised. 

174 Evidence Paper 25: Peng, M. & Meyer, C (2013) 175 Christopherson, S. (2011) 176 Christopherson, S. (2009) 177 Harris, R. (2011) 178 Evidence

4. Exposed to new market opportunities141

Indeed, industrial strategy tends to work most 
effectively when based on a ‘bottom-up’ approach 
that takes account of local partnerships, rather 
than on exclusively a ‘top-down’ approach. There 
is potential for making better use of strong local 
intelligence, for example through Local Enterprise 
Partnerships, in identifying where policy intervention 
is most needed in the manufacturing sector. 

4.3.7 thE rolE of 
‘infrastructurE’

Three attributes that make the UK attractive 
to overseas investors are: quality of life, culture 
and language; the stable political environment, 
and technology and infrastructure181. This section 
looks at two areas which affect current and 
future competitiveness:

  The importance of ‘physical’ infrastructure for 

manufacturing182, defined here as long-lived and 
costly capital assets often with complex design 
architectures required for economic growth and 
development in the public and private sectors183. 

  The importance of the UK’s institutional 

infrastructure, including the legal framework 
governing the operation of firms, how funds 
are raised, and employment protection. 

Physical infrastructure

It is generally recognised that interactions between 
manufacturing and physical infrastructure are 
very poorly understood. However recent survey 
evidence has highlighted that184:

  The quality and reliability of transport and digital 
infrastructure is a significant factor in investment 
decisions (more than 80% of manufacturing 
sector respondents agreed). 

  Digital networks are of growing importance and 

 

a major factor for the smallest firms. 
Energy infrastructure costs are important 
to investment (90% of manufacturing sector 
respondents agreed), with energy infrastructure 
cost is a greater concern than its quality. 

E-infrastructure: The US, China and Japan are 
investing heavily in e-infrastructure to support future 
growth in industrial and commercial sectors, and to 
enable the development of e-science in healthcare, 
transportation, renewable and clean energy, and 
climate modelling. The UK government185 was 
presented with a potential 10-year strategy in 2011 
for bringing scientific, industrial and public sector 
users, hardware and software developers, and 
vendors closer together. This area merits further 
investigation to ensure UK businesses are not left 
behind those of competitor nations.

Transport infrastructure: There are two ways in 
which investment in public capital including in 
transport infrastructure can be thought to raise 
output, either directly by facilitating production 
or indirectly as an influence on total factor 
productivity (TFP). This second effect will come 
through a favourable impact on costs of production 
in businesses which benefit from investment in 
infrastructure. However, transport infrastructure 
also has potential impacts on productivity which are 
not characteristic of rebuilding regional strengths186. 
Most obviously, transport improvements have 
benefits in the form of time savings. There are also 
distinctive wider economic benefits of cheaper 
transport. These include better access to markets, 
and potential growth in the size of agglomerations 
with attendant productivity gains.

It is not surprising that the majority of UK 
manufacturers regard transport networks, especially 
roads, as important or critical to their business. In a 
recent survey, around 70% of participants viewed 
investment in roads as the highest priority for 
investment while half considered that the state of  
UK roads significantly increases operating costs187.  
As road traffic has grown much faster than road 
capacity, government has been criticised for predicting 
but not providing188. Average kilometres per vehicle 
doubled between 1979 and 2007, while the total 
length of the road network increased by 17%. 

Transport infrastructure, particularly roads, is a 
critical aspect of public capital where there is a 
strong case for more investment. Estimates suggest, 
in the absence of road pricing, a case for investment 
of £30 billion on strategic roads between 2015- 
2025 to deliver annual welfare benefits of £3.4 
billion per year, and a GDP impact of £2.3 billion

per year in 2025189, 190. Most of this investment has 
not been made. Reviews of unfunded transport 
schemes regularly show a large number of schemes 
with high benefit-cost ratios191, 192, 193. From a growth 
perspective, the UK has been investing too little in 
infrastructure. The UK net stock of public capital 
relative to GDP fell between 1980-2000 from 
around 64.% to 40.%, with the UK net stock of 
public capital relative to the stock of private capital 
falling from around 61.% to 37%. Recent levels of 
public investment imply these ratios will continue to 
fall. To maintain the level of public capital to GDP at 
a growth-maximising level, investment of about 2.7 
per cent of GDP per year would be needed194 but 
over 1997-2008 the UK invested only 1.5% of GDP. 
Over the period 2012/13 to 2017/18 this will fall to 
an average of about 1%195. 

The LSE Growth Commission196 recently suggested 
that failures in institutional architecture are at 
the root of a failure in UK investment in public 
capital. They propose several new institutions 
with powers delegated by Parliament, comprising 
an infrastructure strategy board with statutory 
responsibility for strategy, an infrastructure planning 
commission with responsibility for delivery and an 
infrastructure bank to provide finance. An alternative 
potential solution to systemic government failure 
could be to make the road network a regulated 
utility with statutory obligations197, 198, 199. 

Institutional infrastructure

Turning to the legal framework governing firms in 
the UK, it is useful to compare different corporate 
governance models operating in other countries. 
In the US, northern Europe and Japan200, there are 
two dominant models. The Silicon Valley model of 
venture capital-funded growth depends on liquid 
capital markets and flexible labour markets. The 
‘productive coalition’ model is based on long-term 
innovation, stable ownership, and institutionalised 
worker-management cooperation. These are ideal 
types and most countries, like the UK, use hybrid 
systems with some of the characteristics of each 
model. However, there is evidence that the existing 
corporate governance framework operating in 
the UK, which generally favours shareholders, 

acts negatively on innovation, with particularly 
unfavourable impact on manufacturing201.

On balance, it is possible to argue that the current 
legal framework in the UK is a deterrent to 
(manufacturing) firms’ undertaking complementary 
investments in knowledge-based technologies and 
firm-specific human capital, given that both generate 
returns over an extended period. However, the UK 
has been successful recently in generating venture 
capital funding for start-ups in sectors such as IT and 
biotechnology202. The question therefore is whether 
a shift in the regulatory framework towards a 
‘productive coalition’ model could only be achieved 
at the cost of deterring venture capital and related 
forms of start-up financing for high-tech firms. This 
is an open question, but it should not be assumed 
that this would be the case. Levels of venture capital 
funding are higher in per capita terms in several 
European countries which do not have the same 
kind of legal underpinning for financial and labour 
markets as the UK. Liberal personal bankruptcy laws 
and fiscal support for early-stage financing may be 
more important determinants of the size of the 
venture capital sector than laws on shareholder and 
employee protection203. It is possible to conclude 
that it may be that existing levels of legal support 
for shareholder rights are too high and employment 
protection laws are too weak to provide necessary 
stimuli to firm-level innovation.

On employment protection, there is evidence of 
a strong and consistent relationship between the 
legal regulation of termination of employment and 
a pro-innovation environment at the firm level204. 
Findings from studies on innovative firms, including 
start-ups, suggest that a hire-and-fire regime is not 
necessarily optimal for venture capital-funded firms. 
It appears that there is little or no prospect of 
increased innovation deriving from policies of labour 
market deregulation205. Overall, there seems to be 
strong endorsement of the need to move towards 
less shareholder protection/liquid capital markets 
and more employee protection. 

189 Eddington, R. (2006) 190 If road pricing were to be implemented, then the much smaller road-investment programme (£5-8 billion) that would be 
justified would generate welfare benefits of about £30 billion (about 1.6 per cent of GDP) and a GDP gain of about half that figure. 191 Dodgson, J. (2009)

capacity in firms. These will include advanced design 
methodologies and tools, advanced supply chain 
management (and advanced customers), and the 
requisite skills base. Given the uncertainty and risk 
that surrounds technological advances, a key factor 
is firms having the capabilities to respond positively 
to change, and take advantage of opportunities, 
rather than be ‘left behind’207. 

The levels of public sector support for R&D  
in the UK are low compared to other countries 
(Table 4.17)208. The UK Government financed R&D, 
in 2011, at a level of 0.57% of GDP, was significantly 
below Korea, the US, Germany, and France. The 
UK figure was some three quarters of the OECD 
average, and some 20% below the EU level of 
spending. This low level of support in the UK was 
not compensated by relatively higher spending on 
R&D financed by industry. 

The most recent OCED data for 2010 shows how 
government outlays on R&D are allocated across 
different sectors. In most countries, including the 
UK, the main recipients are ‘general university funds’, 
defence, economic development, and health and 
environment. In the UK, in 2010, ‘general university 
funds’ and health and environment209 both received 
about 24% of total outlays, with defence receiving 
just over 18%, and economic development less 
than 8%. In comparison, in the U.S., over 51% 
went to defence,210 and nearly 28% to health and 
environment. Of the major OECD countries apart 
from the US, the UK government allocated the 
smallest amount to economic development (the 
OECD average was around 15%; the EU over 
21%, Germany 22% and France over 17%; the 
comparable figure for the UK was 7.6%). 

advicE for policy-makErs:
Evidence suggests that failures in the UK’s 
institutional architecture are at the root of a 
persistent failure in UK investment in public capital. 
A much more coordinated approach that cuts 
across all areas of government is required to help 
to ensure that the needs of manufacturing are 
incorporated into the design of infrastructure 
investments. Coordination issues are discussed in 
more detail in Chapter 7.

As to whether a shift in the regulatory framework 
towards a ‘productive coalition’ model is warranted, 
some evidence suggests that existing levels of legal 
support for shareholder rights are too high and, 
conversely, that employment protection laws are 
too weak to provide necessary stimuli to improving 
productivity levels. This requires a more thorough 
examination to take place within government.

4.3.8 facilitation  
of thE futurE  
commErcialisation 
of tEchnoloGy 
and support for 
innovation

Technology and its commercialisation is discussed 
fully in Chapter 3. However it is important to 
recognise here that the evolution of existing 
technologies, in addition to new product and 
process innovations (i.e., new goods and services to 
replacing older, obsolete ones, a process known as 
‘creative destruction’)206 will continue to shape the 
demand and supply of such goods and services. 

The use of new technologies by firms will require, 
amongst other things, ‘capabilities’ and ‘resources’ 
for their development and operation. Both require 
sufficient investment in R&D and other intangible 
assets to achieve the requisite levels of absorptive 

206 See Schumpeter (1942) 207 See Harris, R. and Moffat, J. (2013b) 208 The OECD produce these data (see http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-
and-technology/oecd-science-technology-and-industry-scoreboard-2011/government-funding-of-r-d_sti_scoreboard-2011-34-en). 209 Evidence Paper 
24: Morton, B. et. al. (2013) have considered the importance of government procurement for manufacturing, and in the area of health they note several 
opportunities for UK manufacturing assuming a coordinated approach from government. 210 As the UK is the world’s 2nd largest exporter of defence 
equipment and technology, defence procurement has a very large impact on R&D and production in manufacturing in the UK.

technical risks from applied research through 
commercial systems integration. The US also has a 
Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR), 
which currently lets $2 billion of contracts annually. 
Since its inception the programme has worked with 
over 15,000 firms, developed more than $21 billion 
worth of research, and over 45,000 patents214.

advicE for policy-makErs:
There is a compelling case for the UK to invest more 
in R&D and more widely defined intangible assets, 
for example ICT, to help ensure that manufacturers 
are well placed to exploit technological change in 
the future and compete internationally. 

While there is a need to maintain existing policies 
that aim to increase connections and encourage 
collaborations between firms by making greater 
use of existing schemes such as Knowledge Transfer 
Partnerships, there needs to be a greater emphasis 
on the firm. Unless firms have sufficient absorptive 
capacity, or ability capitalise on new information, 
they will not be able to fully internalise the benefits 
of any knowledge spillovers, no matter how large 
such spillovers may potentially be.

Linked to this is the need for a significant increase 
in public support to help with the development 
of these new and, by definition, riskier and more 
uncertain technologies (and thus overcome the 
‘Valley of Death’). International evidence suggests 
that the UK is lagging behind its competitors here 
(see Chapter 3).

UK Government support for R&D spending has 
declined to some 60% of the 1985 level (see Figure 
4.30)211, while since 2000, the U.S. and to some 
extent Germany have reversed the decline seen 
throughout this period.

New initiatives are taking place to support R&D 
in manufacturing in many countries212, specifically 
to tackle the need to overcome what is termed 
the ‘valley of death’. This is the period of time 
from applied R&D to full manufacturing-scale 
demonstration (see Chapter 3). For example, 
the Advanced Manufacturing Office of the US 
Government has recognised the need to support 
R&D on technology projects which will help 
manufacturers become more robust, adaptable, 
profitable, and globally competitive213. Working 
jointly with industry stakeholders, universities and 
others, AMO invests in cross-cutting technologies 
to benefit a broad range of manufacturers. These 
include pre-competitive projects that emphasise 
the innovative capacity of small and medium 
enterprises, and innovation stages which involve

5. MORE SUSTAINABLE

In the period up to 2050, interactions between 
manufacturing and the natural environment will be 
subject to a number of powerful changes. 
Growing global populations will raise demand for 
resources, particularly as they become wealthier.  
Climate change is likely to increase the vulnerability 
of global supply chains. Consumers will call for 
products that meet higher environmental standards, 
and governments may increase their use of 
environmental regulations. 

Manufacturers will therefore need to strive for greater 
efficiency in their use of materials and energy, which 
will provide resilience to the resulting volatility in the 
price and availability of resources. Manufacturers will 
also need to explore new ways of doing business, for 
example by expanding into ‘re-manufacturing’ of end 
of life products, or by producing increasingly robust 
products for ‘collaborative’ consumption by consumers.

This Chapter examines a number of these important 
changes and concludes by outlining a range of 
implications for Government, and relevant advice where 
needed, that will need to be addressed as manufacturing 
increasingly becomes more sustainable.

Trends in population and urbanisation will increase 
demand for materials, water, energy and land. As a 
result, these resources will be subject to greater 
competition and therefore increasing prices. 
In some instances this competition could turn 
into resource conflict with clear implications for 
manufacturing firms that tend to have their supply 
chain distributed globally. 

‘Sustainability standards’ and environmental 
regulations are likely to be used more widely 

Governments around the world are likely to set 
increasingly stringent environmental regulations 
due to environmental pressures and as public 
views change

An important future trend is likely to be ‘pricing 
of the environment’, which involves attaching an 
economic value to particular natural resources 

There is a trend for pricing natural resources 
such as carbon and water, and pricing ecosystem 
services such as the ability to clean the air. This 
will provide both challenges and opportunities 
for UK manufacturers.

An ongoing important trend is likely to be 
‘consumer environmental pull’ for products do  
not involve environmental degradation

Continual environmental damage and the 
resultant human costs may mean that customers, 
through their choices, push manufacturing 
firms to continue to reduce their wider 
environmental impacts. 
 

5.1 MANUFACTURING  
AND THE NATURAL  
ENVIRONMENT

KEY MESSAGES
Interactions between manufacturing and the 
natural environment will be subject to a number 
of changes in the decades ahead. Some of these 
‘environmental mega-trends’ are discussed here, 
alongside some of the government and consumer 
reactions to these trends that will impact the 
manufacturing sector. 

A growing and increasingly urban global population 
will raise demand for natural resources and 
influence the location of manufacturing

There are predicted to be 3 billion more people in 
the world in 2050, with global population reaching 
over 9 billion and 70% of the global population 
living in urban areas. The world’s middle classes 
will expand dramatically and the population will 
be older and richer. These demographic changes 
will influence resource availability and location 
decisions of manufacturing firms – for example, as 
certain firms will increasingly want to locate close 
to the customer, this will necessitate the location 
of some factories within urban areas.

Climate change is likely to increase the 
vulnerability of global supply chains and increase 
the pressure on manufacturers to reduce their 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions

There is overwhelming scientific agreement that 
the climate is changing and further change is 
inevitable without reductions in GHG emissions. 
A warmer climate is expected to bring changes 
to rainfall patterns, further sea level rise and an 
increased risk of certain extreme weather events, 
including floods, droughts and heatwaves, in many 
parts of the world. These changes are likely to 
increase supply chain vulnerability.

5.1.1 INTRODUCTION

In the period up to 2050, interactions between 
manufacturing and the natural environment will 
be subject to a number of changes, with significant 
implications for UK manufacturing. The size of 
the global population, where people live, the 
climate, the likelihood of extreme weather events 
and the availability of resources will all undergo 
significant change. In addition, in response to the 
changing environment, there will be developments 
in the push and pull on manufacturers from both 
consumers and government. All of these interrelated 
issues are discussed here and illustrated in Figure 5.1.

BOX 5.1: WHAT IS SUSTAINABILITY?
In this report the terms ‘sustainable manufacturing’ 
and the ‘drive towards sustainability’ are frequently 
used. The definition of sustainability adopted here 
is that described in the widely cited Brundtland 
Report: “development that meets the needs of the 
present without compromising the ability of future 
generations to meet their own needs”1. The premise 
here is that the current widespread economic 
model already requires a world with a greater 
capacity to provide resources and process harmful 
wastes than is possible.

5.1.2 POPULATION 
GROWTH AND  
URBANISATION

Out to 2050, demographic changes will be 
significant. Not only will the global population 
increase, but there will be changes to the age 
profiles, levels of urbanisation and average income 
of populations across the world. Effects will vary 
between countries, but the average person will 
be older, wealthier and more likely to live in a 
city. Demographic changes within the UK and 
abroad will have significant implications for UK 
manufacturers. In this section, trends in population 
size, urbanisation, and wealth are discussed, along 
with what it means for UK manufacturing. These 
issues are also touched on in Chapter 6, where the 
impact of ageing populations is discussed. 

Population growth: It is predicted that there will be 
3 billion more people in the world by 2050, with 
the global population reaching over 9.6 billion2. 
97% of population growth by 2050 will take place 
in developing regions, with 38% taking place in the 
‘least developed countries’3. By 2050, many African 
and Asian states will have a population of over 50 
million people, a significant increase from 2012. UK 
projections suggest the population will increase from 
62.7 million people in 2010 to 77 million by the end 
of 20504. 

Urbanisation: As the global population grows, urban 
centres are expected to absorb the bulk of this 
increase. Forecasts suggest that 70% of the global 
population will live in urban areas by 20505. 
In developed countries the urban population is 
expected to increase very slowly, from 0.9 billion in 
2000 to 1 billion in 2030. Of the 23 cities expected 
to reach 10 million plus by 2015, 19 will be in 
developing countries6. 

Wealth: For the first time in history, a truly global 
‘middle class’ socio-economic group is emerging, 
with annual per capita expenditure between 
US$3,650 and US$36,500 (2005 prices)7. By 2030,  
it is estimated that: 

  This global group will more than double in size 

from 2 billion in 2012 to 4.9 billion;
European and US middle class will shrink from 
50% of the total to just 22%;

 

  Rapid economic growth in China, India, Indonesia, 

Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia will cause Asia’s 
share of the new middle class to more than 
double from its current 30%; and

  64% of the global middle class will be residing in 
Asia, accounting for over 40% of global middle-
class consumption of manufactured products.

What does this mean for UK manufacturing?

A larger, wealthier population will result in increased 
global demand for manufactured products. Given 
that most of the population increase and growing 
middle class will be in developing regions, especially 
Asia, manufacturers will need capabilities to 
understand the new, growing markets and how they 
are set to change (see also Chapter 4). This increase 
in demand for products will result in an increased 
demand for resources: energy, water, land, materials 
and food8.

project. Please see Foresight (2011b). 

5. More sustainable151

The trend for urbanisation will mean that 
consumption will be concentrated in cities, which 
will influence the location decisions of manufacturing 
firms. Manufacturers will increasingly locate closer 
to the customer and this, for some, will involve 
setting up factories within cities9. The implication of 
the need to locate in or near to cities will be that 
manufacturers will design their factories accordingly. 
Firms will not only need to be increasingly 
welcoming to the customer through ‘open’ factories 
(see Chapter 3), but will need to integrate with a 
greater diversity of players as part of the ‘circular 
economy’, an idea discussed in further detail below. 

What does this mean for UK manufacturing?

Climate change could have significant implications 
for manufacturing if supply chains are disrupted 
and if resources such as fresh water are diverted to 
maintain the basic needs of the growing population. 
The extent of the impact will depend both on 
actions taken to mitigate the risks of climate change 
through reducing emissions, but also to adapt to the 
expected impacts. Regulatory pressure to reduce 
emissions in manufacturing is likely to increase. 
Manufacturers will also need to build resilience to 
future climate into their business models. 

5.1.4 FUTURE  
DEMAND FOR  
RESOURCE

Increases in the global population will lead to 
increasing demand for manufactured products, 
accompanied by greater global demand for 
resources. Non-renewable resources such as 
fossil fuels will be progressively depleted and the 
changing climate will make resources such as 
freshwater scarce in some parts of the world. The 
combination of these factors is likely to increase the 
likelihood of resource conflicts. The end result for 
manufacturing will be a reduction in the availability 
of many resources that are key to the sector, 
with greater volatility in their prices. The top four 
natural resources that are critical to manufacturing, 
which will see substantial increases in demand, are 
materials, water, energy and land.

5.1.3 CLIMATE 
CHANGE

Global average temperature is projected to rise 
between 0.7 and 2.4°C by mid-century (relative to 
the start of the century) depending on the level of 
greenhouse gas emissions10. As the climate warms 
rainfall patterns are expected to change, sea level 
will continue to rise, and the risk of some types 
of extreme event, like flooding, heatwaves and 
drought, will increase. The level of warming and the 
associated impacts will vary globally. 

The impact of climate change on the location 
of manufacturing processes globally is extremely 
difficult to forecast, however, an increase in 
frequency or intensity of extreme weather events in 
particular has the potential to damage infrastructure 
and transportation links and disrupt global supply 
chains. Floods in Thailand in 2011, for example, 
shut down factories and disrupted supplies of 
computer hardware to companies in the UK and 
elsewhere. The effects of climate change on food, 
water, health and general regional stability will also 
affect the supply of human resource and cost of 
labour around the world. These combined physical 
and societal impacts of climate change result in 
potentially significant implications for some  
regions’ ability to maintain or develop their 
manufacturing base. 

9 Further details provided in Chapter 3. 10 Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (2013). The provisional final draft Working Group One 
contribution to the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report gives projections of warming for the period 2046 - 2065 
(compared to 1986 - 2005) for four illustrative scenarios: 1.0ºC (+/- 0.3) warming for Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6; 1.4ºC (+/- 0.3) 
warming for RCP4.5; 1.3ºC (+/- 0.3) warming for RCP6.0; and 2.0ºC (+/- 0.4) warming for RCP8.6. 

The future of manufacturing: A new era of opportunity and challenge for the UK152

The future security of supply of materials 

The future security of supply of water

Raw materials used for the manufacturing process, 
including ores, minerals and liquid fossil deposits, 
are unlikely to be depleted in the near future, 
but their extraction is predicted to become 
economically unattractive as easily-exploited and 
high quality sources are used up11. Many important 
manufacturing materials originate in a small number 
of locations outside of Europe. For example, about 
40% of cobalt (uses include batteries, alloys and 
catalysts) is produced in the Democratic Republic 
of Congo and 92% of niobium (used in automotive 
and aerospace industries) is produced in Brazil, with 
most of it coming from a single mine12. Mining and 
production activity responds over time to market 
pressures and price signals to set levels for what it is 
economically viable to survey and exploit. However, 
the fact that the availability of mined materials is 
subject to marked geo-political risk is the critical 
issue that is likely to worsen in the future as the 
accessibility of traditional resources decreases but 
demand grows, resulting in increased competition.

As emerging economies develop, it seems likely 
that competition for resources will be fierce and 
protectionism may ensue as the few countries 
that are suppliers of the rarer metals cease to 
export them. Consequently, the UK manufacturing 
industry faces a growing problem of securing supply 
chains linked to particular materials. This issue was 
highlighted in 2010 when China restricted exports 
of rare earth elements13 used in many electronic 
and advanced technology applications and are 
currently produced by a very limited number of 
countries, principally China, which produces around 
97% of the global supply14. 

To remain competitive, manufacturers will 
need to develop material-efficient processes 
and manage supply chain disruptions, as well as 
recovering precious materials with enhanced 
product stewardship. One such strategy is termed 
the circular economy (see Chapter 3 and later 
discussion in this Chapter) which aims to re-use 
materials rather than extracting materials, using 
them and discarding them, only to start again with 
virgin material. 

Water is a finite resource, with less than 1% of all 
fresh water on the planet available for use15. Future 
competition for water, driven by population growth, 
urbanisation and demographic shifts, may put the 
manufacturing sector in direct competition with 
food production and the basic needs of society. 
By 2050, forecasts suggest that global blue water 
(freshwater from the surface or the ground) 
demand will increase by 55% compared to 2000, 
with a 400% increased demand from manufacturing 
and 140% from electricity generation (see Figure 
5.2)16. Water supply crises are predicted to be the 
second greatest global risk out to 202217. 

Low-income countries will be particularly subject 
to future water scarcity, with 39% of low-income 
countries experiencing a more severe shift towards 
water stress than wealthier, more industrialised 
countries. In China and India, for example, 2.7 billion 
people will be living in water-scarce basins in these 
countries alone by 2050, up from 1.4 billion today18. 
However, areas such as California in the US will also 
be subject to increased risk19.

5. More sustainable153

70% of global water is currently extracted for 
agricultural use and 19% for industrial use20. In 
the UK, over half of the water abstracted is used 
to supply electricity (55%), about one third is 
used for the public water supply (30%), and only 
9% by industry21. The manufacturing sector is the 
largest industrial consumer of water (using 27% of 
volume)22. UK consumption relies heavily on ‘virtual 
water’ imported and embedded in goods that are 
produced from water drawn in their countries of 
origin. Important factors in the future availability of 
water for manufacturing include:

The amount of energy needed to clean and move 
water: This has been increasing in recent years in the 
UK due to a lowering of the groundwater table23. As 
groundwater sources in the UK and globally become 
further depleted, more energy will be required 
to extract the same amount of water through 
unconventional methods such as desalination and 
rain water harvesting, which could be more than 
ten times as costly as conventional surface or 
groundwater pumping24.

The growing global middle class and likely changes 
in diet: This will put added pressure on water supply, 
as more meat and vegetable oils are consumed 
in place of grains and pulses. Production of one 
kilogram of beef requires 15,500 litres of water, 
while the equivalent amount of wheat requires 
1,300 litres25. Studies have predicted increases in 
per capita consumption (kg/capita/annum) from 
37 kg in 2011 to 52 kg by the middle of the 
century, on average, and from 26–44 kg in low-
income countries26. However, it is important to 
note that looking out to 2050, there may be some 
consumption of laboratory grown meat, which, it 
has been estimated, could reduce water usage by 
94% when compared to conventional meats27.

The future security of supply of energy 

Energy demand: In 2010, manufacturing accounted 
for 16.5% of energy demand in the UK28. Projections 
for future energy consumption by the manufacturing 
sector depend upon assumptions regarding the 
output and energy-intensity of its production. 
Baseline scenarios are typically based on small 

improvements in energy efficiency (0.2% per year), 
whereas other scenarios, including predictions by 
the UK Department for Energy and Climate Change 
(DECC), envisage energy demand from industry 
falling by up to 25% from current levels. This would 
involve significant improvements in energy efficiency, 
fuel switching and the use of carbon capture and 
storage technologies29. The critical factor that will 
influence reductions in energy usage will be the 
cost of doing so, however energy saving is likely 
to become cheaper30. A recent report has studied 
energy efficiency activities in the UK as sector 
averages and identified best practice companies, 
also based in the UK, who have out-performed their 
own sector significantly31. For example, chemical 
companies have reduced their energy intensity by 
50% in 15 years. Even in energy intensive sectors, 
the variation from best to average offers great 
scope for competitive advantage.

Energy prices: Out to 2050, there will be a drive 
towards decarbonising the energy system; however 
fossil fuels are still predicted to dominate the energy 
mix. In the short and medium term, the move 
towards a decarbonised energy system is likely 
to involve higher energy prices than the current 
energy system32. However, in the longer term, 
research and development is likely to reduce the 
costs of renewable energy33. Prices of fossil fuels, 
on the other hand, are likely to rise. The DECC 
has projected the price of fossil fuels (oil, gas and 
coal) out to 2030 under three different scenarios35. 
Under two of the three scenarios, the price of all 
three fossil fuels increases. For example, the price 
of gas could rise from 61.4p/therm in 2013 to 
73.8p/therm in 2030 under the ‘central’ scenario. 
However, under the low scenario, the price could 
fall to 42.2p/therm in 2030. But whatever happens 
to the underlying cost of fossil fuels, applying carbon 
capture and storage (CCS) to a power station 
(which most studies suggest will need to be part of 
any reasonably affordable low-carbon system) must 
increase its costs36. These trends in energy prices are 
illustrated in Table 5.137. Increasing energy prices will 
have significant cost implications for manufacturers 
who do not reduce their energy usage to a 
sufficient degree.

On a global scale, world energy consumption is 
predicted to increase dramatically (Figure 5.339). In 
non-OECD countries, industrial consumption will 
rise by around 1.8% per year, however in OECD 
countries it is only expected to increase by 0.6%  
per year (Figure 5.440).

Energy reliability: The concern over energy 
security of supply is ubiquitous, but is likely to be 
exacerbated by local conditions in the UK. Currently, 
the average UK consumer loses electricity supply for 
80 minutes a year41. Most of these outages are due 
to problems in the local distribution systems, but the 
greatest disruption comes when millions of people, 
including businesses, are simultaneously affected by 
a problem in the transmission system or a shortage 
of generation. In the future, there is likely to be an 
increased risk of UK electricity system failure. 

A low-carbon electricity system in the UK, which is 
the aim for 205042, is likely to involve a significant 
proportion of wind generation, which is dependent 
on the weather43. To make the most efficient use 
of the various renewable resources in Europe, it is 
likely that much more electricity will be transmitted 
over long distances. Wind power will come from 
around the Atlantic seaboard (including the British 
Isles) and the North Sea, while solar power will 
most economically come from the south of Europe 
and from North Africa. Hydro-electric stations in 
Scandinavia and the Alps will be able to balance the 
inevitably intermittent output from other sources44. 

Scenario analysis by the UK Office for Gas and 
Electricity Markets (Ofgem) indicates that the risk 
of capacity shortfall is low in the immediate future, 
when substantial spare capacity exists, but it rises 
sharply by 2016-17 as older plants retire. These

therefore need to increase the efficiency with which 
they use land. Developments in the size and location 
of factories, in particular the decrease in size and 
movement of some factories into urban areas, could 
help in this regard (see Chapter 3).

5.1.5 FUTURE  
POTENTIAL FOR 
‘PRICING THE  
ENVIRONMENT’

Ecosystem services are services provided by 
the natural environment that benefit people49. 
Examples include water purification, air purification, 
groundwater recharge, pollination and the 
decomposition of waste. While many of these 
ecosystem services are seemingly free, estimates 
of their monetary value show this to be far from 
true. For example, sea defence services have been 
calculated to be worth between £53 – 199 million 
per annum in Wales alone50. Work is currently being 
undertaken to value many of these ecosystem 
services51 and it may be that in future, those who 
reduce the ability of the natural environment to 
provide ecosystem services must bear a cost, and 
the main beneficiaries of ecosystem services must 
pay to sustain them.

In addition, resources such as carbon and water are 
increasingly being priced into the economy through 
mechanisms such as the EU Emissions Trading 
Scheme and the UK Carbon Price Floor. This trend is 
likely to continue as countries look to ensure GHG 
emissions are taken into account by businesses 
when making decisions with the aim of reducing the 
environmental impacts. 

scenarios do not assess the risk of power cuts 
caused by disturbances to the transmission system 
or sudden changes in generation away from the 
peak hours but it is likely that these risks will rise 
from very low levels as the level of wind generation 
increase45.

Two threats to UK-based manufacturers therefore 
include the price of energy in the UK continuing to 
rise at a faster pace than in competitor counties, 
placing UK manufacturers at a disadvantage. The 
second threat is that a low-carbon electricity supply 
may be unreliable, and that the cost of power 
cuts will rise. There are however two important 
opportunities. UK manufacturers who can reduce 
their electricity usage at times when the power 
system is under stress are already paid for doing so. 
The need for such demand-side management, the 
options for providing it, and the price paid are all 
likely to increase over time. The second opportunity 
is that new low-carbon products will be needed, not 
least in the transport sector, and UK-based firms 
may be able to break into these new markets.

Land space

There are only 1.9 global hectares of biologically 
productive space available per person on earth. 
Given that the average world citizen currently has an 
ecological footprint of 2.3 global hectares46, current 
levels of consumption are clearly unsustainable. This 
is combined with the trend of an increasing global 
population and rising incomes, especially in emerging 
economies. In addition, estimates suggest that of 
the 11.5 billion hectares of vegetated land on earth, 
about 24% had undergone human-induced soil 
degradation in 2009, with erosion the main process 
of degradation47. Although cropland occupies only 
12% of land area, almost 20% of the degraded land 
was once cropped. However, around 16% of total 
land area, including cropland, rangeland and forests, 
is improving, with some significant land reclamation 
projects, for instance, in northern China48. 

The outcome will be much greater competition for 
land space between agricultural crops, living space

5.1.6 FUTURE  
‘SUSTAINABILITY 
STANDARDS’ AND  
ENVIRONMENTAL 
REGULATION

Within the last 40 years greater effort has been 
made by some governments to encourage 
improved environmental performance in the 
industrial sector. By setting standards such as 
ISO14001, environmental management in factories 
in many countries has improved. Out to 2050, 
standards will become increasingly important in 
emerging economies as the population becomes 
wealthier and increasingly demands and expects 
better standards from manufacturers. 

However, moving from standards to reduce local, 
immediate pollution to standards for global, long-
term pollution related to areas such as resource 
extraction, where effects will extend across 
generations, will be challenging. Legislation is likely 
to move away from a focus on reducing pollution 
which has been largely successful in western 
countries, to a focus on resource productivity, 
for example EU legislation diverting electrical 
equipment waste away from landfill. Legislation is 
likely to increasingly concern itself with encouraging 
innovation and changes to business practice.

5.1.7 CONSUMERS 
AND THE  
ENVIRONMENT 

Consumer demand for sustainable products, 
involving reduced energy and material use, is 
growing52, however it is difficult to measure the 
degree to which customers are pushing for these 
types of products, and whether they may be willing 
to pay a premium for such products. However, it 
is possible that in the period out to 2050, given 
increasing awareness of environmental degradation 
and the likely increase in the number of extreme 

weather events, consumers will demand better 
corporate social and environmental responsibility 
from manufacturers.

A number of major companies are taking initiatives 
in this direction, sensing that consumers will 
favour more responsible behaviour, or eschew 
products and services from companies taking the 
contrary view. Unilever’s pledge to double turnover 
without increasing GHG emissions53 and Marks & 
Spencer’s Plan A to go ‘beyond compliance’ on the 
environment54 are good examples. 

Manufacturers will also increasingly need to 
consider the reputational risk of exposure to the 
consumption of energy and other issues throughout 
their value chains. High levels of sustainable 
performance are expected of many suppliers and 
this will only increase. UK manufacturing firms 
are affected by this in their own operations but 
also in the operations of their supply chain, from 
the distribution lorries on UK motorways to the 
recognition of ‘virtual water’ and ‘virtual energy’ 
embedded in products, material extraction and 
working practices of their entire supply chain. 
This is expected to place increasing demand for 
provenance information and we can expect future 
products to present data on the sustainability of all 
the activities along the value chain. 

How will UK manufacturers fair in this 
changing world?

UK manufacturing is in a reasonable position to deal 
with the environmental constraints of the future. UK 
manufacturers also have capabilities in areas that will 
increase in importance out to 2050. For example, 
the UK is internationally competitive in lightweight 
technologies through companies such as Jaguar 
Land Rover, McLaren and others55. These lightweight 
technologies will be increasingly important in 
improving energy efficiency in transport systems 
and there will likely be cross-sector transfer of 
this technological know-how from the transport 
industries to other industries such as construction. 
The UK could therefore sell both lightweight 
technologies and its knowledge in this area to 
generate revenue.

5. More sustainable157

The UK has also moved beyond pollution 
prevention and hence offers better environmental 
performance in its domestic and exported products 
than most countries. Of course, some of the UK’s 
leading international competitors enjoy a similar 
position, though the strengths vary across countries 
and sectors. This will create certain comparative 
advantages for the UK out to 2050, for example in 
exporting UK know-how and research in the ‘green’ 
space – from low-energy drying technology, to 
consultancy services, to the development of exciting 
new bio-materials. 

It is not correct to describe the UK as world-leading 
in putting sustainability at the heart of manufacturing; 
indeed this is a position claimed by no country as 
yet. With most developed countries prioritising 
environmental performance as being critical to 
their future industrial strategies, the opportunity 
exists to take advantage of UK strengths in pollution 
prevention, in adopting resource efficiency, and in 
clean technology.

5.2 IMPLICATIONS 
FOR GOVERNMENT 

KEY MESSAGES
Sustainable manufacturing, requiring manufacturers 
to use less material, energy and other inputs, will 
become critical in giving manufacturers resilience 
to potential volatility in the price and availability of 
commodities, and in supporting competitiveness.

Growing competition for resources and the 
potential for increased volatility of commodity 
prices, along with a changing climate, will create 
conditions where manufacturers will have 
to take action to help safeguard their future 
competitiveness. 

A shift to more sustainable manufacturing 
will be critical, requiring manufacturers to use 
less material, energy and other inputs; make 
better use of alternative inputs; and embrace 
alternative business models. Sustainable 
manufacturing will be important in supporting 
the economic sustainability and competitiveness 
of manufacturers, and will make valuable 

contributions to wider environmental sustainability. 
A range of technological advances, including 
the full integration of ICT and sensors into 
manufacturing processes, will help enable 
movement towards a more sustainable 
manufacturing system. 

There are three key areas for the UK Government 
to focus on to help manufacturers address this 
shift to sustainable manufacturing as it no longer 
becomes optional:

  Near term changes: The need to maximise 
efficiency and resilience in the supply and 
use of materials, energy, water and land, and 
to support developments, including urban 
manufacturing, close to the customer.

  Preparing for 2025 and beyond: The need for 
industry-government-academia partnerships 
to be formed to prepare for disruptions in 
the price and availability of material, energy 
and other inputs, with experimentation and 
new business models including the ‘circular 
economy’ approach to reusing end of life 
products encouraged; and by ensuring supply-
chain resilience. 

  Preparing for 2050 and beyond: The need to 

help manufacturers create value from any 
‘positive externalities’ of their operations. 
These would include any private or societal 
benefits to a third party caused when a product 
is consumed. For example, new developments 
in technology could enable factories to become 
cleaner, quieter, and sought after neighbours in 
densely populated areas. 

5.2.1 INTRODUCTION

The combination of trends relating to the natural 
environment, particularly the growing competition 
for resources and a changing climate, will create 
conditions where manufacturers will have to act to 
safeguard their future competitiveness. In addition, 
technological trends (see Chapter 3) such as the full 
integration of ICT and sensors into manufacturing 
processes, lightweight materials, material substitution, 
and evolving process technologies will help 
enable this transition towards a more sustainable 
manufacturing system56.

56 See Chapter 3 for further discussion of the technological trends impacting manufacturing out to 2050

The future of manufacturing: A new era of opportunity and challenge for the UK158

The onset of this transition can already be observed 
in the UK. For example, sensors are currently used 
for monitoring the performance of many vehicles, 
to ensure repair and remanufacturing takes place 
before breakdown occurs, whilst local customisation 
and personalisation of products is already well 
established in products such as Nike trainers and 
‘made to order’ Dell computers.

As well as becoming increasingly necessary from 
an economic and environmental perspective, 
sustainable manufacturing will become an important 
basis for differentiation in the market place, and for 
additional, and innovative value-creation. There are 
valuable opportunities here for the UK in utilising 
its skills and knowledge to research, develop and 
commercialise products that can be produced 
and used in a sustainable manner. However, the 
drive towards sustainable manufacturing will also 
create challenges and industry will have to conceive 
business propositions and technologies which satisfy 
multiple constraints simultaneously.

In this section, the need to shift towards a more 
sustainable manufacturing sector is discussed, 
focussing on three stages of transition: efficiency and 
resilience (2013 – 2025), experimentation with new 
systems and business models (2025 – 2050) and the 
world of 2050 (see Figure 5.5). 

5.2.2 A FOCUS ON  
EFFICIENCY AND  
RESILIENCE  
(2013 – 2025)

During the period 2013-2025, sustainable 
manufacturing can be expected to focus primarily 
on achieving improvements and efficiencies in 
the use of raw materials, for example metals57, 58 
, and other inputs such as energy, as a strategy to 
hedge against volatility in commodity prices and 
increasingly vulnerable supply chains.

5. More sustainable159

Capital costs in factory design and infrastructure will 
constrain the magnitude of physical changes that 
are feasible. However the UK manufacturing sector, 
particularly the aerospace and automotive sub-
sectors, has strengths in adapting to best practice59 
and making small adjustments. This section considers 
the resource management techniques that will be 
important out to 2025.

Resource management 

Delivering the highest possible output of products 
from a given volume of resources (resource 
productivity) and using the lowest possible 
volume of resources to deliver a particular output 
(resource efficiency) are overarching strategic 
goals for industrial manufacturing processes. The 
improvement of both resource productivity and 
efficiency will become increasingly critical for the 
manufacturing sector in the future60 as a result of 
changes in the availability and cost of materials, 
water and energy; government environmental 
regulations; ‘pricing’ of the environment61; and 
consumer ‘pull’ for more environmentally and 
socially sustainable goods. Manufacturers are likely 
to use a combination of approaches to resource 
management to remain competitive over the next 
decade and beyond which include: 

 

Efficiency gains through best practice: For 
example, 27% of freight truck journeys in 2007 
involved a vehicle running without a load62. 
Efficiency gains can reduce costs and enhance 
reputation in terms of cost-effectiveness and 
green credentials. 

  Clean and resource efficient technologies: 

These are needed to drive re-manufacturing 
and recycling, and to enable more effective 
management of materials, energy and water. 

  Widespread integration of sensors into 

products and factories: These will generate 
vast amounts of information, ‘big data’, which 
leading manufacturers will use to analyse how 
their customers, factories and supply chains are 
operating. Sensors will also enable new products 
and processes which will provide opportunities 
to reduce material waste and increase the 
quantities of products which are monitored, 
repaired or refurbished before breakdown. 

The key risk for the UK manufacturing sector is that 
it will be slow to adapt to these changes in resource 
management, making it vulnerable to supply chain 
shocks and rising resource costs. However, each 
new method for resource management provides 
an opportunity for the UK. If it can adapt quickly, 
it could gain first mover advantages. The need for 
improved resource management techniques will 
open up many new markets and opportunities for 
manufacturers, for example, in novel materials that 
are biodegradable, and in energy and water efficient 
technologies. The UK must therefore ensure that 
it is competitive in the design, development and 
commercialisation of these new technologies. The 
next section covers the key areas in which effective 
resource management will be needed: materials, 
energy, water and land. 

Materials

Growing demand for materials, resulting in greater 
competition, higher prices and greater geo-political 
risk, means that manufacturers, out to 2025 and 
beyond, will need to increase the efficiency with 
which they use materials. A number of approaches 
are possible: 

  Minimising material inputs – substitution: This 
involves replacing a critical material input to 
manufacturing with an alternative material, with 
any approach depending on the material and the 
product. Most progress has been made in finding 
alternatives to petro-chemically-derived materials 
that are susceptible to strong price volatility, for 
example fibres for structural composites derived 
from sustainable bio-feedstocks, such as hemp 
and flax63. However, some materials used widely 
in UK manufacturing are not easily substitutable. 
Platinum, used in catalytic converters in motor 
vehicles is one such example. Reserves and 
production of platinum are concentrated in 
one country, South Africa64, so any restrictions 
in supply would have a detrimental effect on 
the UK automotive industry, which accounts for 
around 5% of manufacturing GVA65. In addition, 
some materials are becoming more expensive 
and difficult to dispose of, so there is a strong 
case for substituting them with materials66 
derived from sustainable sources or materials 
that are readily bio-degraded after use.

trailers and semi-trailers’. 66 Evidence Paper 10: Grant, P. & Mason, T. (2013)

The future of manufacturing: A new era of opportunity and challenge for the UK160

  Minimising material inputs – dematerialisation: 
This involves using less material to achieve the 
same level of functionality in a product and is an 
area which the UK is strongly placed to exploit 
existing capabilities in lightweight materials 
including composites67. The UK has additional 
potential to lead research into multifunctional 
materials, where combinations of material 
properties are used to conduct two or more 
tasks68. 

  Waste management (re-use, re-manufacturing 

and recycling): This entails reducing waste, 
recycling larger volumes and developing 
increasingly efficient recycling methods. 
Businesses such as British Gypsum are already 
embracing this way of operating (see Box 5.2) 
and the approach is being applied to certain 
materials for example cobalt, which had an 
‘end of life recycling rate’ of 68% in 2010 
driven by its high cost69. Rising demand for 
recycling capability will provide an opportunity 
for UK manufacturers who produce recycling 
technologies. It is also worth stressing that 
additive manufacturing technology (see Chapter 
3) is likely to make important contributions 
to waste per unit of output falling70. However, 
the ability to recycle critical materials varies 
considerably across materials. For example, 
recycling of fluorspar, a material important within 
the chemicals sector, is usually not feasible71. 
Firms may need to develop capabilities in 
recycling and re-manufacturing their products to 
increase their resilience to supply chain shocks. 

BOX 5.2: BRITISH GYPSUM CASE STUDY
In 2011, British Gypsum recycled 34,000 metric 
tonnes of used plasterboard to make new products 
and recovered 93,000 pallets from customers for 
re-use. This has reduced the need for raw gypsum 
from its quarry significantly. The initiative has been 
combined with a zero-waste to landfill target 
and the application of world class manufacturing 
production techniques. As a result, British Gypsum 
has avoided paying £9m a year in landfill tax and 
closed three in-house landfills, placing plasterboard 
on a stronger sustainable footing for the future72. 
The role of government in shaping the actions 
of the gypsum industry has been crucial and has 
included working with Department for Environment 
Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) (waste strategy 
2007 and site waste management plans), the 
Environment Agency (position statement on land 
filling of gypsum, and work with the Waste and 
Resources Action Programme (WRAP) on quality 
protocols for gypsum) and the DEFRA programme 
to produce a gypsum road-map with the sector73. 

It is useful to distinguish here between the different 
methods for dealing with a product once the 
consumer no longer wants it, which is often not at 
the ‘end of life’ stage:

  Re-use: Redeploying a product without the need 

for refurbishment, for example second hand 
motor vehicles. 

  Re-manufacturing: Returning a product to 

the performance specification of the Original 
Equipment Manufacturer and giving a warranty 
close to that of a newly manufactured equivalent.
  Cascaded use: Using a product for a lower value 
purpose, for example turning used clothes into 
pillow stuffing or redeploying computers within a 
business for less demanding applications.

  Recycling: Extracting a product’s raw materials 
and using them for new products, for example 
aluminium and steel are widely recycled.

  Recovery: Using a product’s materials for a 

basic, low value purpose such as road base or 
combustion to produce heat74.

5. More sustainable161

manufacturing firms would result in a reduction in 
carbon dioxide emissions of 4.6Mt81. Developments 
in sensor technology (see Chapter 3) will provide 
opportunities for manufacturers to monitor 
their energy usage and improve energy efficiency. 
Additionally, the greater freedom of design that 
additive manufacturing will allow could be used to 
help develop energy efficient products which will 
improve overall competitiveness by providing a cost 
saving for the customer.

Decarbonising manufacturing energy: Firms which 
use significant amounts of energy are likely to 
face higher energy costs in the future resulting 
from a rising carbon price82. There are a number 
of actions that can be taken to minimise costs, 
including sourcing energy from low-carbon suppliers, 
producing low-carbon energy in-house, and 
reducing energy usage by co-locating with other 
industries to use any waste energy. If the UK can 
develop capabilities in specific renewable energy 
technologies, it could provide both increased 
security of energy supply for the UK and gain a 
significant market share if it is a first mover. For 
example, the UK’s island geography means that 
it is well suited to generating tidal wave energy83. 
This technology is not yet highly commercialised 
and as such provides an opportunity for the 
UK to lead. It has also been estimated that UK 
manufacturing can potentially capture value from 
low-carbon technologies relating to areas including 
tidal and wave energy, carbon capture and storage, 
and offshore wind worth £39.5 – £126.5 billion 
between 2010-2050, rising to £190 – £878 billion if 
supply chains are considered84.

The first two methods in the list are likely to 
increase in importance in the future. Re-use and 
re-manufacturing tend to capture more value 
than recycling as they preserve much of the value 
created through the manufacturing process. For 
example, a re-used iPhone retains around 48% of its 
original value, whereas its value as recyclate is just 
0.24%75. 

However, it is important to note that although rates 
of recycling in the UK have been rapidly improving 
in the last decade, re-manufacturing is currently 
limited: In 2011, re-manufacturing only represented 
approximately 1% of the total UK manufacturing 
sector turnover76. This is likely to continue to be 
the case out to 2025, but looking out to 2050, the 
value that manufacturers gain from re-manufacturing 
will change drastically as it becomes an increasingly 
integral part of the manufacturing process. 

Energy

In the decades ahead, the world is likely to 
experience rising energy costs, greater demand 
for energy from manufacturing firms, decreased 
security of energy supply and a growing imperative 
to decarbonise the global economy77. The associated 
challenges and opportunities for manufacturers 
will depend on whether they are users of energy, 
providers of technology used in energy generation 
or transmission, and the energy required to use their 
product. The actions that will need to be taken can 
be broadly grouped into improving energy efficiency, 
decarbonising manufacturing energy, and improving 
the security of energy supply. 

Energy efficiency: Since 2002, with the rapid rise in 
energy prices, manufacturers have expanded their 
energy efficiency programmes to reduce costs, 
with most manufacturing sub-sectors improving 
their energy intensity at 4% per annum or more78. 
Approaches have included improving the design 
of equipment, better management practices, 
improved production processes, and off-shoring79. 
Moving the entire UK manufacturing sector to 
current ‘best practice’ improvement rates would 
offer an energy savings of £1.9 billion per year80. 
From an environmental perspective, estimates 
indicate that a 20% reduction in energy use by

Ensuring security of the UK energy supply: Power 
system outages or disturbances have significant 
impact on the reliability and quality of the 
worldwide electricity supply. In an increasingly 
digital future world, even the slightest disturbances 
in power quality and reliability would cause loss 
of information, processes and productivity. The 
security of supply of the future UK energy system 
is likely to worsen, even in the short term. Figure 
5.685 illustrates the potential economic impact of 
power outages on UK manufacturers. Significant 
investment in electricity networks is therefore likely 
to be needed, particularly in new technologies for 
transmission, distribution and energy storage. Their 
potential benefits include enabling low carbon 
energy supply systems, and facilitating flexible 
control and efficiency to ensure security of supply 
when power flows are variable. These variable 
power flows arise from uncertainties of generation, 
demand and energy market transactions. The 
demand for these new technologies will provide 
significant manufacturing opportunities out to 2050.

Water
Rising demand and therefore the rising cost of 
water in the future86 will drive increased water 
efficiency amongst manufacturers, as well as the 
development of technologies which maximise water 
efficiency87. Trends in water supply, cost and quality 
could have particularly significant implications for the 

biotechnology sector, as there may be impacts on 
costs for using living organisms in the manufacturing 
process. Some UK manufacturers are leading the 
way on water efficiency. For example, Unilever 
is on track to abstract 40% less water per tonne 
of production in 2020 relative to 2008 across its 
network of global factories88. 

Increasing demand for water efficiency is likely to 
provide new markets for manufacturers of machinery 
and technology used in a wide range of industrial 
processes. However, UK manufacturers will face 
strong international competition in this area. Siemens 
Water Technologies, for example, are already leaders 
in providing water solutions, both equipment 
and services, to companies around the world89. 
The growing demand for clean water by people, 
concentrated in cities, and manufacturing processes 
will provide manufacturers with new markets. For 
example, desalinisation technologies will become more 
important, as will efficient methods for transporting 
water from source to sink. By locating closer to one 
another, manufacturing firms in the UK could minimise 
their water usage and maximise opportunities to use, 
for example, waste water within a cooling process 
which does not require a high quality of water.

Land 
Demographic trends suggest that the global 
population will, by 2050, on average be larger, 
wealthier and more urbanised90. These trends, 
combined with a greater demand for food and 
bio-fuels, will place pressure on land use around 
the world, including in the UK, causing land prices 
to rise. Looking out to 2025, the likely reaction of 
manufacturing firms will be to improve the efficiency 
with which they use land in production processes. 
Manufacturers may, for example, increasingly build 
vertically rather than horizontally, co-locate different 
parts of the value chain, and share resources with 
other firms and sectors. More changes can also be 
expected in the farming-industrial system in terms 
of cooperation between farms and supply chains. 
Already companies such as AB Sugar in the UK help 
their farmers to reduce their use of energy, water 
and fertiliser while increasing yield91. However, the 
more radical and exciting developments in land use, 
for example through locating factories within cities, 
are more likely to be seen post-2025.

Looking to the future – what does this mean for 
UK manufacturing?

There is strong evidence that the UK manufacturing 
sector possesses the capabilities required to 
address the challenges of efficiency and supply 
chain resilience, which will be critical out to 2025. 
However, its performance is currently undermined 
by a lack of sufficient directed investment, resulting 
in the UK being a mediocre performer in resource 
management compared to its peers in the EU-2792. 
Some countries, for example China, are already 
making significant advances in resource efficiency 
(see Box 5.3). Support for improved resource 
management in manufacturing needs to be a priority 
for UK policy makers over the next decade.

BOX 5.3: EFFICIENCY IN CHINESE 
MANUFACTURING 
Re-use of industrial waste in China is already being 
implemented via the enforcement of a ‘Circular 
Economy Promotion Law’ in 2009, with theories of 
‘industrial symbiosis’93 put into practice by national 
and provincial governments who plan the agricultural, 
industrial, service, and other sectors. Numerous 
eco-industrial parks have also been implemented94 95. 
China plans to spend some US$454bn over the next 
five years on environmental protection, a doubling 
over the previous period, and a signal of a growing 
market for environmentally effective manufacturing 
technologies96.

ADVICE FOR POLICY MAKERS: 

Adapting regulations

Regulation for energy reduction: Effective energy 
reduction at no cost to the consumer has been 
demonstrated by some innovative schemes such 
as ‘Top-Runner’ in Japan97. In this initiative, future 
product standards are set so that all products 
manufactured at a set point in the future must be 
at least as good as the best performance of today. 
This consumer-facing scheme could potentially 
be mirrored by ‘top-runner factories’ in the UK, 
assessed on energy usage.

Regulation on landfill reduction: The UK could 
consider going beyond the current landfill tax 
escalator, for example by putting a future landfill 
ban on glass, metal and other materials with a high 
energy input. This could be followed by slowly 
escalating the ban, for example by preventing 
recycled glass from being used in road-building, to 
promote re-use, re-manufacturing and recycling. 

Forward looking government procurement: 
Procedures need to be established to encourage 
supply of the best ‘clean technology’ equipment 
measured by long-term environmental and social 
performance in government procurement, as an 
incentive to UK manufacturers.

Integration into the industrial strategy: Using UK 
industry and research competence to ensure that 
sustainability is an integral part of the UK’s industrial 
strategy. Failure to do this may encourage a trade-off 
between industrial success and sustainability.

Targeting R&D to improve resource efficiency 

Material science:  The development of novel materials 
is a potential UK strength given the UK’s strong 
research capabilities in this area. The search for new 
materials that use local resources, or reduce the weight 
of energy-using products, or allow new functions to 
minimise waste, should be given high priority

Improved and more rapid recycling and recovery 
technologies: For example, to enable non-destructive 
removal of high-value parts from electronics within 
seconds, or recovery of metals from complex end-of-
life products such as vehicles and aeroplanes. 

Flow analyses for raw materials: This could 
differentiate dependencies on materials imported 
as raw material versus those embedded within 
finished or semi-finished components to inform a 
programme to reduce vulnerability to key materials. 

Quantify potential reserves of critical raw materials 
in the UK: For example, assess the reserves of 
important manufacturing materials in UK mines.

will only occur with a shift in thinking amongst 
manufacturers away from the simple ‘make, use and 
dispose’ approach. While there are some leading 
companies making significant efforts in this area, for 
example, Unilever and Marks & Spencer, efforts in 
the UK are uncoordinated and distant from what is 
required in terms of scale or scope. 

Sharing information

Consumer understanding and information: 
Consumers who are aware of the water, energy 
and material footprint that a product holds need to 
be encouraged to make informed choices. To meet 
the demand from consumers for more information 
on the provenance of products requires improved 
product standards, information-labels and education 
materials. 

Rapidly increasing the competence of the industrial 
system: The UK already has notable leaders in many 
of the dimensions of industrial sustainability, plus 
a number of competent institutional systems (for 
example the Technology Strategy Board, and Waste 
and Resources Action Programme). Actions already 
being taken by these and other organisations could 
be scaled up to ensure manufacturers have access to 
information to help them improve their sustainability.

5.2.3  
EXPERIMENTATION  
WITH NEW SYSTEMS 
AND BUSINESS  
MODELS (2025 – 2050)

Looking beyond 2025, efficiency improvements are 
unlikely to be enough for UK manufacturers to thrive 
in a rapidly changing world. UK manufacturers will 
have to move beyond ‘regular’ innovations in terms 
of increasing efficiency through material extraction, 
use and dumping. They will need to embrace 
experimentation with new systems of manufacturing 
and new business models98 which significantly increase 
their sustainability. This is also likely to support a 
‘decoupling’ of national economic growth and 
well-being from environmental impacts such as the 
emission of harmful substances. Absolute decoupling 

In the period 2025-2050, when efficiency measures 
are likely to have been exhausted, there will be a 
need not only for radical innovation in business 
models but also in supply chains to provide greater 
resilience. The increasing incidence of extreme 
weather events and susceptibility of factories and 
resources located around the world will increase 
a range of global risks for the UK manufacturing 
sector99. Both areas, business models and supply 
chain resilience are discussed in the next section.

Future business models and sustainability – 
creating value in a changing world

It is likely that many more aspects of value 
associated with manufactured products will become 
important in the future, including sustainability, 
personalisation, guarantees of provenance, and 
information which becomes ‘attached’ to products. 
At the same time, ownership will become 
increasingly decoupled from product use, facilitated 
by technology. The business models used by firms to 
create, deliver and capture this value (see Chapter 
2) are therefore likely to change.

New forms of value associated with environmental 
and social sustainability mean that firms and policy 
bodies must understand, exploit and influence 
the role of standards, accreditations and other 
mechanisms by which value is captured. An obvious 
development here is for growth in demand 
from customers for products with guaranteed 
provenance which are supported by ubiquitous ICT 
and sensors. Concerns about treatment of remote 
supply chain workers, for example Bangladeshi 
textile workers, point to greater demand for 
more oversight and responsibility. Information 
technology will also allow changes to be made to 
systems and products, allowing further radical de-
constructing and re-constructing of the activities 
involved in product manufacturing and product use. 
In this section, three relevant business models are 
considered: the circular economy, servitisation, and 

98 See the USA Advanced Manufacturing Initiative for early examples of this. The White House (2012) 99 Further details of extreme weather events and 
their potential impact on supply chains can be found in Section 5.1.3

5. More sustainable165

By associating a cost with both end and waste 
products of a linear value chain, the chain can be 
joined up either with other value chains, forming 
networks of industrial symbiosis, or with itself, as 
conceived in ‘closed-loop’, ‘cradle-to-cradle’ or 
‘circular economy’ strategies102 (see Figure 5.7103, 
which shows how materials can be kept within 
the value system). These ideas were discussed 
extensively at the project’s three international 
workshops104 and are being developed in the UK 
by organisations including the Royal Society for the 
Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA) and the 
Ellen MacArthur Foundation105. 

Material scarcity, oil prices, extreme weather events 
and wider sustainability pressures may lead to a 
desire for greater self-sufficiency within national 
borders, or at least within Europe. As such, it is 
possible to envisage a manufacturing system where 
re-manufacturing and re-use is the norm, and 
origination of products from virgin raw materials is 
the exception. Manufacturing sub-sectors that offer 
the greatest opportunities to capture significant 
value from circular resource use are electrical, 
electronic and optical products, machinery, and 
equipment and transport equipment106.

collaborative consumption. They provide solutions 
to different problems and therefore should not be 
considered as mutually exclusive. 

The circular economy

The scarcity of materials, combined with growing 
costs and environmental impacts of energy 
consumption and waste disposal make the 
original manufacture of products less desirable. 
Manufacturing firms will be pushed towards systems 
that entail a ‘circular flow’ of products and allow a 
shift from a linear economy to a circular economy 
i.e. from an economy based on the conversion 
of raw materials into products which end their 
lives as waste, to an economy where products are 
re-used, ‘re-purposed’, repaired, re-manufactured 
and recycled, cascaded, and recovered (see earlier 
definitions in this chapter) rather than being used 
and discarded. This concept of the circular economy 
is already established in some firms (see Box 5.4).

EMBRACING THE ‘CIRCULAR ECONOMY’
Caterpillar Inc.: Caterpillar is a US based leading 
manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, 
diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines, 
and diesel-electric trains. The business runs ‘Cat Reman’, 
a re-manufacturing programme that returns products 
at the end of their lives to same-as-new condition, and 
seeks to find new ways to reduce, re-use, recycle, and 
reclaim materials which once would have gone into a 
landfill. During 2012, Cat Reman took back over 2.2 
million end-of-life units for re-manufacturing100.

JC Bamford Excavators Ltd (JCB): JCB is one of the 
world’s top three manufacturers of construction 
equipment, based in the UK. Through the JCB Service 
Exchange, the business helps plant users to reduce 
owning and operating costs, with a comprehensive 
range of re-manufactured parts for all its machines. 
Around 1650 high quality parts, all re-manufactured 
to Original Equipment Manufacturer standards and 
protected by the same warranty conditions as new 
parts, are offered. With typical savings against new parts 
of 40-50%, the re-manufactured parts can restore 
machines to their optimum condition at a more 
affordable price. Furthermore, re-manufactured parts 
are upgraded to incorporate the latest technology101.

DESIGN FOR A CIRCULAR ECO N O M Y

co-located to utilise what would be waste for 
one business as resource for another. This has the 
potential to reduce reliance on virgin raw materials 
and mitigate against volatility in energy prices 
(see Box 5.5).

The shift towards a circular economy, combined 
with a trend of pricing ecosystem services, could 
provide manufacturing firms with new revenue 
streams. Currently manufacturing can involve the 
production of by-products which are considered 
waste and with a zero price value, for example 
waste heat, and ecosystem services which produce 
clean water. As these by-products become 
increasingly valuable, they can be traded between 
manufacturing firms and more widely in the 
economy. Business models that capture value from 
under-utilised resources include those characterised 
as ‘industrial ecology’, where industries are generally 

5. More sustainable167

Collaborative consumption and changing ownership

‘Collaborative consumption’109, a type of rental 
model, may become more prevalent in the face of 
environmental pressures. It focuses on developing 
business models based on shared use of assets, 
rather than individual outright ownership, facilitated 
by online methods for finding, booking and paying 
for use. It shifts consumer values from ownership to 
access. Collaborative consumption is also linked to 
the trend of servitisation of the manufacturing sector.

Examples of collaborative consumption are leasing 
of car fleets, and car rental. In a rental model, 
firms are providing customers with the service 
that the product offers, rather than the product 
itself. Benefits for the customer include low-capital 
requirements and lower risk from not owning the 
product. Collaborative consumption also creates 
wider social, environmental and financial benefits by 
deliberately setting out to internalise costs which are 
traditionally externalised, and where the superior 
technical knowledge and/or co-ordinating capacity 
of the manufacturer can be used to reduce the 
impacts of total life cycles. 

For example, contracts that provide customers with 
cars at a fixed cost per mile travelled (including 
fuel) would encourage the car manufacturer to 
offer very efficient vehicles as they make increased 
profit by purchasing less fuel but offering the same 
miles travelled. Collaborative consumption and 
experimentation with business models hold great 
potential but require well developed buyer-supplier 
co-ordination. There is a potentially important role 
for government procurement which uses a whole 
‘life cost’ approach as a tool for reducing costs and 
supporting industrial innovation.

BOX 5.5: INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY  
CASE STUDY
Adnams plc: Adnams, a UK brewer, has developed 
a number of initiatives based on principles of 
industrial ecology. A solar-powered anaerobic 
digester converts brewery and local food waste to 
fertiliser and biogas, replacing liquid fossil fuel in their 
transport fleet. This approach, when implemented, is 
predicted to reduce the company’s CO2 emissions 
by 200%107.

However, all these developments will only be 
possible with the innovative use of existing 
technology, and further technological developments. 
The integration of ICT and sensors (see Chapter 3),  
enabling the sharing and intelligent use of 
information, will enable greater coordination and 
collaboration between businesses, and between 
business and consumers. This coordination and 
collaboration is critical to establishing the circular 
economy as a viable business model in the UK 
manufacturing sector.

Servitisation

Services will provide important ways to create extra 
value (see Chapter 2) as manufacturers support, 
complement or enhance their products. Servitisation 
will become an intrinsic part of a manufacturing 
which exists within more circular, interactive 
ecosystems where value is created between, rather 
than predominantly within, firms. 

However, managers in manufacturing firms often 
find organisational, conceptual and institutional 
obstacles to bringing about these bold moves into 
services. If the addition of services is at least in 
part an indication of innovation in business models, 
the UK lags behind a number of international 
comparator nations, with the US being the most 
advanced108. Service innovation is much more 
inter-organisational in nature than product 
innovation and, especially, process innovation. This 
suggests that firms’ capabilities in interacting with 
network counterparts to bring about the types of 
innovation needed to develop new business models 
may need to be strengthened.

The future of manufacturing: A new era of opportunity and challenge for the UK168

Looking to the future

The exact approach to models for a circular 
economy and collaborative consumption will 
vary depending on the firm. However, there 
are common principles that will be required. 
These include products that need to be designed 
for durability, standardisation of components, 
modularity and ease of disassembly to facilitate 
upgrading and re-manufacture, and low toxicity 
to allow for biodegradation. 

Technological trends therefore have important 
implications for the types of business models that 
can be used in the future. New manufacturing 
technologies, such as additive manufacturing and 
green chemistry110, will decrease the material and 
energy intensity of products, with the additional 
benefit of being economic at a smaller scale than 
traditional manufacturing equipment. This will 
encourage experimentation with the scale and 
location of manufacturing, as well as business 
models. For example, some factories may choose 
to locate next to customers and use more local 
materials, while others might locate near a reliable 
source of renewable energy. Consumers will 
be offered much greater product choice which 
approaches personalisation. In some cases products 
may be personalised, for example, drug delivery 
systems. Physical components will be replaced with 
software where possible, offering manufacturers’ 
choice in where they locate their activities.

It is important to note that these business models 
have not been extensively tested and it is not clear 
how they will work for businesses and consumers 
in a hyper-consumptive economy or in rapidly 
growing markets where ownership can be a 
sign of affluence. Numerous barriers have to be 
overcome for the circular economy model to be 
fully adopted in manufacturing. What is clear is that 
it will fundamentally change the way manufacturing 
is conducted as products will have to be redesigned 
to be considerably more durable. 

Sustainability111 has become a pervasive long-term 
theme in the discourse on the future development 
of manufacturing business models. However, other 
than niche companies, there is little evidence to 
suggest that the UK is engaging with this radical 

agenda at the scale necessary to either reactively 
or proactively capture future value from the 
challenges to sustainability expected in the next 
20 years. Support for research in the broad area of 
sustainable manufacturing and the development of 
new business models, plus support with translating 
research findings into commercial value, would lead 
to significant opportunities for the UK. This support 
is currently lacking112.

Resilience of supply chains

Traditionally, businesses have prioritised short-term 
cost-efficiency, through for example off-shoring and 
out-sourcing manufacturing, and reduced inventory 
capacities, and many have come to rely on single 
sourcing rather than having alternative suppliers. 
However, in recent years supply chains have become 
more vulnerable as a consequence of globalisation 
and this trend is likely to become stronger as 
environmental challenges grow in the future. 

Lower costs and a lack of in-house or national 
capability lead many UK manufacturers to have part 
of their supply chain located overseas. Twenty per 
cent have half of their suppliers outside of the UK, 
with Asia supplying over half of UK manufacturers113. 
Asia and Pacific countries supply materials which 
are essential to the UK manufacturing sector, 
including iron ores, copper, aluminium and industrial 
minerals114. The most significant impacts of 
disruption to overseas supply chains are reported to 
be loss of orders and revenue, followed by delayed 
cash flows115. UK manufacturers have responded 
to the challenge of vulnerable supply chains by 
expanding overseas collaboration, sourcing from 
multiple suppliers (despite quality control issues and 
increased transaction costs), and increasing their use 
of local suppliers and on-shoring. 

Looking out to 2050, supply chains will need 
to show redundancy to be resilient. This means 
having alternative distribution networks, including 
alternative modes of transport and suppliers. A 
supply network where multiple potential supply 
chains can form as needed should be more 
resilient, but would be accompanied by increased 
transaction costs. Redundancy is ostensibly at odds 
with efficiency, where buffering capacity is removed 
to save transaction costs. However, in the long

term and in the face of significant disruption from 
the effects of climate change and rising population 
growth, additional costs may be negligible compared 
to the costs of inflexibility. A more collaborative 
approach to supplier interaction is yielding significant 
benefits for pioneering manufacturers who are 
creating efficiencies between multiple steps in their 
supply chains (vertical collaboration116) and across a 
breadth of suppliers (horizontal collaboration117).

ADVICE FOR POLICY MAKERS: 
Business model innovation: This is a critical 
component of preparing for a disrupted world. 
The potential of new business models need to 
be explored at increasing pace, depth and scale. 
Barriers, such as differential tax rates for services 
or service innovation and investment, need to 
be removed.

Business model innovation through internalisation: 
There is a need to reward and recognise 
those business models that seek to internalise 
environmental costs. For example, by encouraging 
business models that focus on re-manufacturing and 
re-use, and avoid dissipation of polluting or harmful 
substances. An encouraging study carried out by 
WRAP has shown there is a great opportunity for 
businesses to repair and re-sell home electronics. 
Waste from electrical and electronic equipment 
(disposed of via household waste recycling centres) 
is estimated to be worth £200 million in gross 
revenue per year118.

Procurement: There is a case for building 
competence in government procurement which 
encourages innovation, accounts for the impacts 
of decisions on product life cycles, and seeks to 
internalise environmental costs. This could be 
achieved through challenge-led procurement i.e. 
asking manufacturers to develop a solution to a 
particular problem rather than asking them to 
provide an existing product or service.

Urban planning: In the future, some factories will 
want to be closer to the customer or to supplies of 
materials. These factories may be much smaller and 
less polluting; they may even be in the local retailer. 
The UK planning system will need to adjust as 
needed so that appropriate mixed-use development 
is not discouraged.

Experience shows that it is often best to 
experiment before a disruption occurs, so that 
knowledge and tools are already available to tackle 
any adverse impacts, and take advantage of any new 
opportunities. Many of these actions could begin 
now and slowly scale-up to create significant UK 
adaptive capability.

5.2.4 SUSTAINABLE 
MANUFACTURING  
IN 2050

The drive for sustainability will create a multitude 
of challenges and opportunities for global 
manufacturing which the UK needs to grasp. 
By 2050:

  Manufacturing firms could be part of a wider 
‘circular economy’, requiring some degree of 
co-location with other firms. 

  Many products will have more value but use 

smaller amounts of energy and material, where 
the material is not land-filled but kept in a 
productive loop. 

  Technological developments resulting in cleaner, 

quieter factories that reduce pollution levels 
through their processes, will enable factories to 
be built in more densely populated areas. 

  Urban manufacturing could foster greater levels 
of collaboration due to the close proximity of 
suppliers, competitors, consumers and academic 
institutions. 

  Waste heat from factories could be 

used in nearby schools, and the greater 
interaction between industrial enterprises 
and schoolchildren would help to dispel the 
misconceptions about manufacturing that many 
people hold119. 

  Resilient supply chains will have in-built 

redundancy at all stages, including re-manufacture 
and recycling; greater security of energy supply will 
lead to increased resilience to power disruption.

116 Vertical collaboration is the pooling of resources and capabilities by complementary organisations up and down the supply chain 117 Horizontal 
collaboration is the pooling of resources and capabilities by competing organisations across the supply chain 118 WRAP (2013) 119 Evidence paper 19: 
Livesey, F. (2013)  

The future of manufacturing: A new era of opportunity and challenge for the UKSub-sector detail: The future form of sustainable 
manufacturing operations needs to be explored 
in detail for each subsector through research and 
collaborative road-mapping. For example, WRAP 
provide several studies explaining the business 
cases for the repair and re-sale of specific types of 
technology, for example white goods, power tools 
and desktop computers. It also offers one-to-one 
support for businesses who wish to implement a 
repair service as part of their offering121.

International cooperation strategies: To help ensure 
competitiveness, the UK needs to play a central 
role in developing international strategies for 
resource extraction and use. These are likely to 
become increasingly important out to 2050 as 
growing demand will place greater pressure on 
natural resources.

Intellectual Property: The regulatory system for 
intellectual property needs to become more 
flexible and adaptable as new technologies and 
business models develop and become common-
place. Government must consider the implications 
of the shift towards a circular economy for 
intellectual property as rates of repair and re-
manufacturing rise. The boundary between repair 
and reproduction is currently blurred and may 
become more so with the ease of copying parts122.

 

170

 

Factories that allow customers to interact with 
their products as they are being made could 
enable greater personalisation of certain goods. 
A customer that can see their car being made 
will feel more involved in the process and may be 
willing to pay more for a personalised product.

  The relationship between customer and 

manufacturer will undergo profound changes, with 
more customers having their data used to create 
personalised products, and to identify other needs 
that even the customer is unaware of.
  Governments may lean towards the 

implementation of policy regimes which 
recognise the public good of manufacturing, and 
help manufacturers to internalise those effects. 
  The ability of manufacturers to access finance 
and technical resources will mean that factories 
can for example, bring potable water to a village 
or offer waste heat for local housing.

A more sustainable manufacturing sector in 
2050 has the potential to be both exciting and 
competitive. Ultimately it will be essential in a 
dramatically changed world. However its success will 
depend on both an appropriate policy environment 
created by government and a UK industry which is 
willing to take radical steps to innovate in the way it 
does business.

ADVICE FOR POLICY MAKERS: 
Policy measures that facilitate a shift towards a 
circular economy: This also directly addresses 
conservation of critical resources. Product policies 
such as eco-design standards involving minimisation 
of critical raw materials, and design for recovery; 
developing purchasing demand through green 
public procurement; continually introducing 
measures for producer responsibility to promote 
value recovery120 (i.e. producers have a responsibility 
to deal with a product after the customer has 
finished using it); and supporting efforts to scale-up 
circular material flows by, for example, promoting 
information sharing and collaboration between 
firms and wider society.

6. INCREASINGLY 
DEPENDENT ON 
HIGHLY SKILLED 
WORKERS

The people who work in the UK manufacturing sector will  
play a critical role in how manufacturers create and capture 
future value. 

Strong future demand for workers is likely, however within a 
context of small further reductions in the total workforce size. 
Demand will be for workers with ‘hybrid skills’ – deep technical 
specialism combined with commercial and problem solving 
abilities – and with Science, Technology, Engineering and 
Mathematics (STEM) qualifications.

Manufacturers will need to rise to new challenges including 
accommodating greater numbers of older workers, and 
considering the potential role of future human enhancement. 
Ongoing issues will also need addressing, including the poor 
public perception of manufacturing, particularly amongst young 
people and women, and the quality of UK manufacturing leaders 
and managers compared to key international competitors.

This Chapter examines a number of important changes relating 
to the role of people in manufacturing. It concludes by outlining 
a range of implications for Government relating to the future 
quantity, quality and utilisation of suitably skilled people 
who will be critical as manufacturing becomes increasingly 
dependent on highly skilled workers.

6.1 THE ROLE  
OF PEOPLE IN  
MANUFACTURING

KEY MESSAGES

Despite historic declines, future demand for 
manufacturing workers will be strong

  UK manufacturing employment has declined 
significantly in the past (nine million people 
in 1966 and below three million in 2011). 
Any future declines will be much smaller, with 
around 170,000 fewer people in the sector 
expected by 2020 compared to 2010. 

  However, there will still be strong demand for 
workers, with around 800,000 roles to be filled 
up to 2020 as people retire or leave the sector. 
Manufacturing output is likely to continue 
increasing without associated increases in 
direct employment.

  Over the period to 2050 the UK will have an 
ageing population, with the number of people 
aged 65 years and over (i.e. of ‘traditional’ 
retirement age) set to increase, while the 
numbers of ‘traditional’ working age are set  
to decrease. By 2030, 17% of the population 
will be aged between 60-74. 

  Manufacturers may need to accommodate 

greater numbers of older workers, and respond 
to growing markets for ‘age-neutral’ and  
‘age-specific’ products. 

Demand will be for workers with a technical 
specialism combined with commercial  
and problem-solving abilities, in addition  
to STEM qualifications 

  To be successful in high value manufacturing,  
the UK and other developed economies will 
need to compete in the future on the quality  
of their workforce.

  With regard to future demand for skills, 
by 2020 an additional 80,000 people in 
the UK are expected to be employed in 
managerial, professional and technical roles 
in manufacturing. This is likely to contribute 
towards these roles eventually accounting 

 

for around 40% of total manufacturing 
employment.
Factories of the future are likely to require 
workers with a breadth, depth and mix of skills. 
Interdisciplinary ‘hybrid skills’ will need to 
blend specific technical skills, with commercial 
competence and problem-solving abilities. 
  This implies strong demand for workers at 
apprentice, degree and technician level with 
STEM qualifications, particularly in product  
design and development roles, Future demand 
could exceed supply, particularly as only 
a quarter of engineering and technology 
graduates tend to work in manufacturing six 
months after graduation.

Perception of manufacturing and the quality of 
leaders and managers are key issues

  The UK currently fares poorly, when compared 

internationally, on the quality of its managers. 
For example, 42% of managers in UK 
manufacturing firms have degrees, compared 
with 60% or more in India, Japan, Germany, the 
USA and France. Strong leadership teams and 
distributed leaders in key positions throughout 
manufacturing businesses will become critical  
in the future. 

  Young people and women tend to have a 

negative perception of manufacturing, with  
67% of girls aged 7-11 years indicated that  
they would not like a job in manufacturing 
compared with 44% of boys. If this continues, 
it may well affect the number and profile of 
people considering or choosing manufacturing 
as a career.

Other key issues include changing labour costs and 
potential human enhancement

  Changes in relative labour costs by country 
will be complicated by changes in exchange 
rates, advances in technology and automation, 
productivity differentials and other factors.  
As a result, the identities of competitors will 
continue to change.

  By 2050, human enhancement to improve 
mental performance and mobility, and to 
counter biological ageing, may have impact  
on the manufacturing workforce.

6.1.1 INTRODUCTION

The people who work in the UK manufacturing 
sector will play a critical role in how manufacturers 
create and capture future value. Nine areas of 
change, summarised in Figure 6.1, are reviewed in 
detail in this section. Individually, each area of change 
has the potential to have high impact. Collectively 
and in their various potential combinations, the 
changes are likely to transform the number and 
nature of manufacturing jobs available.

The future of manufacturing: A new era of opportunity and challenge for the UKThe use of Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 
categories to measure employment tends to 
overstate the loss of manufacturing employment. 
Some activities formerly coded to manufacturing 
now appear in services but it is beyond doubt that 
the overall loss of jobs in manufacturing has been 
substantial. The pattern of a declining share of total 
employment accounted for by manufacturing as an 
economy becomes more prosperous is evident in 
many countries4 By 2011, the proportion of total 
employment in manufacturing in the UK at about 
10%5 was not substantially different from most 
of the rest of Western Europe and North America, 
although it was lower than in Germany, Italy 
and Japan.

The most acute impact of manufacturing job loss 
in Great Britain has been felt at the scale of the 
local labour market in the north and the midlands. 
Those in manual and unskilled occupations have 
been affected most acutely 6 (see Box 6.1). It is not 
only the manufacturing workforce which has borne 
the brunt of job losses in the sector. More broadly, 
competition in the labour market means that 
worklessness gravitates to those with the weakest 
positions in the labour market, who have low  
skills, poor health and unstable work histories. 
This tendency is likely to continue in the future.

6.1.2 THE LONG-TERM 
DECLINE OF  
EMPLOYMENT IN 
MANUFACTURING

There has been a long-term decline in employment 
in manufacturing in the UK. It seems likely that the 
biggest reductions in employment have already 
occurred in the final three decades of the 20th 
century. In 1966 there were nearly nine million 
people employed in manufacturing in the UK 
(defined according to the Standard Industrial 
Classification (SIC)). By 2011 this had decreased 
to below three million, or 10% of the workforce1, 2, 
(see Figure 6.2)3. Amongst the largest declines were 
those experienced by the textiles industry, which 
employed over 800,000 workers in 1966 and only 
70,000 in 2011. Similarly, the shipbuilding and marine 
engineering industry employed over 200,000 people 
in 1966 but only 40,000 in 2011.

6. Increasingly dependent on highly skilled workers 177

Despite this overall decline, projections indicate that 
there will still be about 800,000 manufacturing roles 
to be filled by 2020 due to people leaving or moving 
within the labour market. 

Looking to the decades ahead, it seems likely that 
few ‘low value and high employment’ manufacturing 
activities will remain in the UK, even in the context 
of some onshoring (see Chapter 4). Manufacturing 
in the UK will therefore be mainly ‘high value, low 
employment’10 and is unlikely to lead to the creation 
of significant numbers of new jobs11. Activities that 
do not fit with this expected trend are likely to be 
in market niches that:
  Are relatively insulated from international 

competition; and/or

  Have difficulty in transporting raw materials/ 

products long distances; and/or

  Are intimately associated with where they are 
produced12, for example food associated with  
a specific region, or branded clothing associated 
with a specific country.

6.1.3 COMPETING  
ON WORKFORCE  
QUALITY

To be successful in high value manufacturing 
activities, the UK and other advanced economies 
will need to compete in the future on the quality of 
their workforce13. Currently the UK has longstanding 
strengths in advanced manufacturing sub-sectors, 
such as pharmaceuticals and aerospace, where 
workforce quality is a key ingredient. Developments 
in existing and new technologies provide potential 
opportunities to enhance strengths in these and 
other high value manufacturing activities. If these 
opportunities are to be realised, the supply of skills 
will need to keep pace with the demand for a high 
quality workforce.

BOX 6.1 IMPACTS OF REDUNANCIES IN 
MANUFACTURING
Closures of large manufacturing plants tend to be 
well publicised. The very large redundancies such 
as the loss of 6,500 jobs at the MG Rover plant 
at Longbridge in the West Midlands in 2005 are 
now infrequent but job losses still have important 
local, regional and human impacts. When localised 
manufacturing job losses occur, the employment 
outcomes and trajectories of the workers involved 
are a function of: 

  The employability attributes of the individuals 

concerned; 
Local demand, and geographical mobility which 
influence transitions into new employment; and 

 

  The effectiveness and take up of policy 

interventions to help redundant workers7. 

Three years after the closure of the MG Rover plant, 
and in the context of a relatively buoyant economy, 
90% of the workers had gained new employment. 
However, the majority of individuals reported a 
decline in real earnings. It was the younger and more 
highly skilled workers who were able to find new 
jobs most quickly, often in the manufacturing sector, 
whereas older and less skilled workers took longer to 
find work, and after retraining often took up positions 
in services. 

These outcomes were achieved in the context 
of significant economic growth and diversification 
of the local and regional economy. They were 
supported by policies to up-skill the local and 
regional workforce and a policy response to  
mitigate the impact of the closure8.

Future manufacturing employment

It is likely that future increases in output in 
manufacturing will be associated with some further 
reductions in the overall size of the manufacturing 
workforce, with around 170,000 jobs expected to 
be lost between 2010 and 20209 (see key messages 
box in Chapter 4 for alternative projections).

6.1.4 CHANGING  
LABOUR COSTS

6.1.5 CHANGING  
DEMAND FOR SKILLS

Even though workforce quality will be critically 
important in the future, labour costs will not be 
irrelevant. The share of labour costs, compared to 
materials, energy and other costs, varies markedly 
between sub-sectors of manufacturing. With trade 
liberalisation, labour-intensive tradable sub-sectors 
of manufacturing, including clothing, textiles and 
footwear, have shifted away from Western Europe 
and the US to low-cost locations. These locations 
have changed over time, as shown by the shift 
away from China to countries such as Bangladesh, 
Cambodia, Indonesia and Vietnam. Consumers’ 
concerns about working conditions in some of 
these countries may lead to increased labour and 
production costs in the future, so reducing the 
current comparative advantage of low-cost labour14. 
In some other segments of manufacturing, labour 
costs are lower as a share of total costs and so 
there has been less imperative to seek low labour 
cost locations.

Changes in relative labour costs in different 
countries compared to the UK mean that the 
identity of the UK’s competitor countries might 
change. Over time, low-cost locations may 
potentially shift to become higher-cost locations. 
The picture is likely to be complicated further 
by changes in exchange rates, and advances in 
technology and automation. For example, advances 
in technology and automation appear set to imply 
reductions in labour content, so making labour costs 
a less important factor. However, a shift away from 
mass production towards small batch manufacturing 
may mean increased labour costs in terms of 
research and development (R&D), and design, and 
limited potential for cost savings in production.

Skills demand is driven by a mix of factors including 
technical change, regulation, globalisation, political 
change, demographic change, and strategic locational 
choices made by companies. At the firm level, the 
marketing strategy for products is a key driver of 
demand for skills. Some firms demand relatively low 
skills and pay relatively low wages in a low value 
added segment of the market, while others have a 
product market strategy demanding high skills, pay 
relatively high wages and compete in high value 
added markets15. 

Medium-term employment projections by 
occupation for the UK suggest an increase in the 
share of employment in managerial, professional 
and associate professional and technical roles in 
manufacturing between 2010 and 2020. A net  
increase of nearly 80,000 additional people 
employed in these roles in the UK is projected (see 
rows 1, 2 and 3 in Table 6.116), which would result 
in these roles comprising around 40% of the total 
projected manufacturing employment of around 2.4 
million in 2020. This implies a continuing demand for 
workers at degree and technician level, particularly 
in product design and development roles. 

This increase is projected to occur in the context 
of a projected overall net decline of 170,000 jobs in 
manufacturing across all occupations by 202017, with 
skilled trades occupations and process, plant and 
machine operatives being the largest contributors 
to employment decline. However, once ‘replacement 
demands’ created by people leaving the workforce 
due to retirement or moving within the labour 
market due to career changes and other reasons are 
factored in, there will be a positive total requirement 
in each occupational group and for nearly 800,000 
jobs to be filled overall by 202018. Many roles and 
sub-sectors in manufacturing will face significant 
net requirements for workers. This means that 
despite a projected employment decline in total 
manufacturing jobs, employment opportunities in 
manufacturing will remain.

14 McKinsey Global Institute (2013a). 15 The former may be characterised as being in a ‘low skills equilibrium’, while the latter are in a ‘high skills equilibrium’ 
(see Finegold, D.  & Soskice, D. (1988). 16 This is a reproduction of Table 2.1 in Evidence Paper 36:  Wilson, R. & Hogarth, T. (2013) 17 Evidence Paper 36:

These projections are for the period to 2020, based on assumptions about the future made at the time that 
the projections were prepared. There is greater uncertainty regarding employment projections further into 
the future. However, in the absence of major breaks in trend, a similar pattern of change would be expected 
although sub-sectors within manufacturing may have specific requirements (see Table 6.219, 20 for selected sub-
sectors). However, beyond 2020, there are likely to be future skill demands for managers, professional staff and 
technicians across all these sub-sectors.

The importance of STEM skills

It has long been recognised that the acquisition 
and utilisation of STEM skills is critical to the ability 
of UK manufacturing to develop and maintain 
high value product market strategies. The total 
demand21 for Science, Engineering and Technology 
(SET) professionals between 2012 and 2020 in 
manufacturing has been estimated at 100,000 in the 
UK. Construction, business services, and computing 
and telecommunications display similar or higher levels 
of demand for SET professionals over this period, with 
a total demand of 830,000 across these sectors of  
the economy22.

Demand for STEM graduates is high, with 
employers across many sectors of the economy 
seeking generic skills associated with STEM 
qualifications (for example numeracy, IT skills and 
logical thinking). This is borne out by findings from 
the Futuretrack study which showed that STEM 
graduates believed that the subject they studied 
was an advantage when looking for employment 
and were more likely than non-STEM graduates  
to find the job they wanted23, 24, 25.

21 Calculated as expansion demand plus replacement demand. 22 Harrison, M. (2012) 23 Futuretrack tracked applicants for a full-time place in higher education 
in 2006 as they made their way through the undergraduate stages of higher education and onwards 24 Purcell, K., Elias, P., Atfield, G., Behle, H. Ellison, R.  & 
Luchinskaya, D. (2013) 25 See relevant work, due to be published shortly, on the the supply and demand of high level STEM skills, by the Institute of Employment, 
University of Warwick, on behalf of the UK Commission for Employment and Skills.

6. Increasingly dependent on highly skilled workers 181

Is the future supply of skills sufficient to meet 
future demand?

Analysis by the UK Commission for Employment 
and Skills has suggested that by 2010 across the 
economy as a whole there were more people 
with STEM degrees in the UK than were working 
in roles defined as STEM graduate occupations26, 
highlighting that a STEM degree does not always 
lead to a STEM graduate occupation. However 
concerns remain about a shortage of STEM 
graduates for manufacturing and econometric 
research reported by the Royal Academy of 
Engineering in 2012 indicated that the projected 
demand for 830,000 SET professionals in 2020 
exceeds supply. 

The situation for engineering and manufacturing  
is exacerbated by the pervasive demand for STEM 
skills across the economy27. Statistics from Higher 
Education Statistics Agency (HESA) reveal that only 
around a quarter of engineering and technology 
graduates are working in manufacturing six months 
after graduation. The remainder, accounting for 
the majority of STEM graduates, are working in 
distribution, finance and business services28. It 
seems likely that manufacturing will continue to 
face strong competition from other sectors for 
STEM graduates.

Some employers recruit from outside the UK to 
meet shortfalls in supply, and to seek the best talent, 
more generally, and for strategically important skills29. 
Changing immigration rules may mean that some 
employers will face greater challenges in sourcing 
some of their skills requirements internationally, with 
implications for UK competitiveness. There may 
be scope to reduce levels of recruitment of non-
European Economic Area (EEA) migrants through 
improvements to education and training for UK 
potential employees, but employers argue that this 
shift requires government investment and support30.

The supply and demand for STEM skills is not 
limited to graduates. Good quality apprenticeships 
also have a role to play in attracting high calibre 
entrants to manufacturing to fill technician roles 
(see later discussion in section 6.2). The opportunity 
of ‘learning while earning’ is proving increasingly 

attractive to young people and offers the advantage 
to them, and to the employer, of developing 
vocational expertise alongside an understanding 
of the business. Apprentice Academies set up by 
major manufacturing employers, for example  
Rolls Royce and Mercedes Benz, show what can  
be achieved. 

6.1.6 THE FUTURE 
NEED FOR ‘HYBRID 
SKILLS’

The ‘factory of the future’ is likely to be 
characterised by flatter management structures, 
a more highly skilled and IT literate workforce 
capable of being reskilled in advanced technologies, 
and soft skills for managing operations effectively, 
and understanding the customer31 (see Chapter 
3). This suggests a need for a breadth, depth and 
mix of skills. Manufacturing activities will require 
people to work in multi-disciplinary teams and to 
have inter-disciplinary expertise. This is because 
different skill sets are needed to optimise business 
performance for different product market strategies 
and at different stages of product and service  
life cycles. 

‘Hybrid skills’ which encompass knowledge of 
different technologies, combinations of specific 
technical knowledge and generic skills, and the 
ability to work collaboratively across networks 
combining technical and commercial competence, 
will be increasingly important in the decades ahead. 

This has been recognised in the US, where a survey 
commissioned by the Manufacturing Leadership 
Council32 has suggested that while engineering 
and technical skills dominate future skills needs, 
management and computer science were ranked 
third and fourth. In terms of future functional 
requirements, understanding the principles of lean 
manufacturing, and collaborative skills were ranked 
equal first in order of importance, followed closely 
by computer proficiency, and design and sales skills. 
The requirement for engineering and technical

skills is not new, but in future what will be required 
is greater expertise in computing-related fields and 
greater competencies in organisational collaboration. 
These requirements place an enhanced responsibility 
on management to ensure that requirements are 
met, both technologically and culturally.

6.1.7 THE FUTURE 
ROLE OF LEADERS 
AND MANAGERS

Leaders and managers play an important part in 
dealing with the technological, economic, political 
and social forces affecting manufacturing firms.  
Their role is to:

  Align activities and resources with strategy,  
up and down the organisational hierarchy;
  To coordinate across units, along the entire 

supply chain, and with the stakeholder 
community (including universities and training 
providers) and

  To adapt to changing circumstances and future 

market shifts. 

Leaders and managers have a central position in 
driving the future role of people in manufacturing 
activities. Strong management practices are associated 
with high quality firm performance, with substantial 
differences in management style evident across 
countries. The profile of manufacturing CEOs in the 
UK is similar to the US and Germany in terms of 
gender (mostly male) and age. But UK CEOs are 
generally less educated in comparison to their global 
peers33. Average scores for management practices 
in surveys of manufacturing in different countries 
show that Great Britain scores below the US, Japan, 
Germany, Sweden and Canada, but is on a par with 
Australia, Italy and France. 

One driver of these scores is the skill level of 
managers. The UK fares relatively poorly on 
this indicator, with only 42% of managers in 
manufacturing firms having degrees, compared with 
60% or more in India, Japan, Germany, the US and 
France34. But differences in management practice 

scores vary more within countries than between 
them. A key challenge facing UK manufacturing is the 
longer tail of poorly managed firms in Great Britain 
(7% of the total) than in countries such as the US 
(less than 2% of the total)35 Yet in Great Britain as 
in other countries, the average manager thinks that 
his or her firm’s management is well-above average. 
Raising the management quality of British firms is 
critically important.

In the face of future globalisation, technological 
developments and macroeconomic uncertainty, 
leaders need to adopt a forward-looking 
perspective while not being susceptible to every 
new trend. Looking out to 2050, it is not only 
the role of CEOs that is crucial, but also senior 
leadership teams and distributed leaders in critical 
positions throughout organisations. In the future, 
the role of distributed leaders in coordinating 
organisational activities across networks and aligning 
firm strategy up and down hierarchies will become 
increasingly important36.

6.1.8  
MANUFACTURING 
AND PUBLIC  
PERCEPTION

Over at least the last decade there has been 
concern about the possible impact of a negative 
image of manufacturing amongst the public in 
the UK. There are similar concerns in the US that 
manufacturing work is seen as ‘dull, dirty and 
dangerous’37. Negative attitudes to manufacturing 
can matter, particularly when these attitudes reflect 
an out-dated perception. If people are not attracted 
to the sector, there are potential implications 
for skills shortages which may constrain growth. 
However, it is unclear whether there are particular 
thresholds at which negative views of manufacturing 
should be a cause for future concern.

33 Only 83% of the top-100 UK CEOs hold a university degree and 29% an MBA, compared with 100% holding a university degree in the USA and 
Germany, and 40% holding an MBA in the USA.  See Evidence Paper 15: Homkes, R. (2013) 34 See www.worldmanagementsurvey.com 35 Evidence

and Technology (2012)

‘Myths’ and ‘realities’: evidence on public 
perceptions of manufacturing

Despite the policy debate on the image of 
manufacturing, the evidence base on public 
perceptions of manufacturing is thin. A nationally 
representative survey of 1,452 adults in the UK 
undertaken in January 2012 with eight core 
questions showed that, on balance, the public 
believed manufacturing to be a high technology 
industry, with jobs that are unstable, low paid, 
and the first to be moved to other countries38. 
The survey also emphasised the view that the 
UK produces many good ideas but is not good at 
translating those into products and businesses. On 
balance, there was disagreement with the statement 
that ‘the UK economy can grow without a strong 
manufacturing sector’. 

This disagreement was greater amongst older 
than younger respondents. Younger respondents 
(18-34 years) had a lower level of agreement 
that manufacturing requires high skills (36% agree, 
21% disagree) than the over 55s (49% agree, 23% 
disagree). There was a marked age difference 
in whether respondents would encourage their 
child to pursue a career in manufacturing with 
31% agreeing and 18% disagreeing amongst older 
respondents (aged 55 and over) and 13% agreeing 
and 34% disagreeing amongst younger respondents 
(18-34 years). 

Young people and women tend not to have a 
positive image of manufacturing and this may 
impinge on the number and profile of people 
considering or choosing manufacturing as a career. 
Evidence also suggests that over half of secondary 
school students believe manufacturing to be ‘dirty’, 
40% consider that manufacturing is boring, and 
only 15% say they would consider a career in 
manufacturing39. The review does not cover how 
many teachers have experience in manufacturing 
and whether, if there were more, they would 
present a more positive view.

Women have more negative attitudes towards 
manufacturing than men, and these are apparent 
from an early age. This is evident at ages 7-11 years, 
when 44% of boys indicated that they would not 
like a job in manufacturing compared with 67% of 
girls40 and more women (46%) than men (35%) 
aged 17-19 years describe manufacturing as ‘male 
dominated’41. For women in their penultimate  
year of university ‘engineering’ is considerably  
less appealing as a career (12% said they would  
be interested), compared with science (26%)  
and education (27%)42.

The negative perceptions held by women are 
significant, particularly given that they only account 
for 23% of the UK manufacturing workforce43, with 
31% of FTSE 100 manufacturing firms having a board 
composition of 25% or more women44. The situation 
in the US is similar, where women account for 24% 
of the manufacturing workforce45. The Perkins Review 
of Engineering Skills, due to be published shortly, will 
provide analysis on a number of important strategic 
issues, including gender balance46.

An improving image?

There is some evidence suggesting that since 
the economic crisis in 2008, and in the context 
of debate on the rebalancing of the economy, 
the public image of manufacturing has become 
somewhat more positive. Over half of the adult 
population in the UK in recent surveys identify the 
manufacturing sector as high-tech and the most 
important sector in helping the UK economy to 
grow in the short- and medium-term future. A 
survey of 1,748 adults in Great Britain in July 2012 
showed that 55% of the sample believed that 
manufacturing will be one of the most important 
industries in helping the economy to grow in the 
next two years (i.e. 2012 to 2014), and 53% believe 
it will be important in the next 10-20 years47.

The future of manufacturing: A new era of opportunity and challenge for the UK184

6.1.9 DEMOGRAPHIC  
CHANGE AND THE 
AGEING SOCIETY

One of the more uncertain trends affecting 
manufacturing is the ageing of the population.  
This is a global phenomenon, with the pace of 
change, and projected population age profiles 
varying between countries. The ageing of the 
population in the UK is not particularly fast by 
European standards, nor in a global context, where 
the Asia-Pacific region has the oldest (Japan), largest 
(China) and many of the fastest growing ageing 
populations (China and Singapore)48.

Over the period to 2050, the number of people 
aged 65 years and over (i.e. of ‘traditional’ retirement 
age) is projected to increase, with the fastest 
growth amongst the ‘very old’ age groups, while the 
numbers of ‘traditional’ working age are projected 
to decrease. By 2030, 17% of the population will be 
aged between 60-74, with the proportion of the 
population over 75 overtaking this group in 2050. 
This ageing of the population is often posed as a 
challenge, but it also presents opportunities.

More time in good health and working longer

Despite the heterogeneity of the older population, 
for most individuals an extended lifespan will not 
mean extended ‘old age’, but more time in good 
health, accompanied by more disposable time and 
income than was the case for previous generations. 
The increase in healthy life expectancy has led 
to a ‘third age’ of active retirement, affecting both 
consumption patterns and attitudes to work.

Some older people may want to stay in work longer 
beyond ‘traditional’ retirement age. Policy is operating 
in the same direction, encouraging individuals to ‘work 
longer’49. A previous trend to early retirement has 
been reversed. The employment rate of people aged 
55-64 years in the UK rose from 50.7% in 2000 to 
57.1% in 2012, and the employment rate of people 
aged over 65 years has seen marked increases in the 

last few years, reaching 6.7% in 2012. UK pension 
arrangements and flexible labour markets make it 
easier to organise delayed and flexible retirement in 
the UK than in most competitor countries. 

In general, policies for age management in the 
workplace endeavour to achieve a balance between 
older workers’ resources (including their health, 
functional capacity, competences, values, attitudes 
and motivations) and work demands (the work 
organisation; the work community; and leadership). 
Longitudinal research suggests that line managers 
play a key role here, but that training is required 
to raise their awareness50. Training, provision of 
assistance to older job seekers, addressing negative 
employer’s perceptions of older workers, relatively 
higher labour costs (if wages are not in line with 
productivity), improving working conditions for older 
workers (ergonomically and otherwise) and offering 
more flexible working, including part-time work, 
are important in strengthening the employability of 
older workers51.

There are particular challenges of making 
manufacturing attractive to older workers, especially 
through more flexible working and phased 
retirement. Currently, employers in manufacturing 
lag behind those in other sectors in managing ageing 
workforces. Older workers in manufacturing are 
more likely to report excessive workloads and have 
a worse work-life balance than older workers in 
other sectors52 (see Table 6.3)53. They experience 
lower levels of flexible working making other 
sectors more attractive to many older people.  
The challenge is particularly pertinent for 
sub-sectors with the oldest age profiles, including 
manufacture of machinery, fabricated metal 
products, basic metals, and other transport. 
These sub-sectors are projected to face significant 
‘replacement demand’ to replace large numbers 
of retirees. This challenge has particularly 
important consequences for Small and Medium 
Enterprises (SMEs) where older workers are 
disproportionately concentrated54.

6. Increasingly dependent on highly skilled workers 185

From an employer’s perspective, workers in 
different age groups may be regarded, either 
on the basis of ‘myths’ or ‘experience’, as having 
different attributes including physical strength, 
technical skills, organisational skills and ‘soft skills’. It 
is possible that employers may distinguish between 
groups of (potential) workers on this basis. In 
general, employers tend to suggest older workers 
are particularly strong in ‘soft skills’ (compared 
to younger people), but this is less applicable 
in manufacturing where older workers have 
traditionally had little contact with customers. 

Living longer – active retirees as a growth market

With a rise in the share of the population in older 
age groups there is likely to be a big growth market 
in demand for ‘age neutral’ products (i.e. those 
designed for people of all ages) by older people 
who are active, healthy and have greater spending 
power. This suggests that successful manufacturers 
will need to take an age inclusive approach to 
product development, extending their market 
reach, and focussing less of their marketing on 
youth than in the past. Views differ on whether the 
spending habits of older generations in the future 
will be different from those in the past55. One 
important distinction is that current and future older 
generations are more ICT literate.

Living longer – the very old

Alongside the growth in demand for ‘age neutral’ 
products by older people, an increase in the 
numbers of the very old suggests that there will 
be growing demand for ‘age specific’ products and 
services geared towards older people with limited 
capabilities associated with the features of ‘biological 
ageing’. These are increasingly common after the 
age of 70 years (including deteriorations in vision, 
hearing, thinking, communication, locomotion, 
reach and stretch, and dexterity). Such ‘age specific’ 
products and services are especially (but not 
exclusively) associated with healthcare, so that 
older people can remain independent for longer. 
This suggests that an ageing population offers 
opportunities for exploitation of new markets for 
products aimed specifically at those older people 
(and others) with limited capabilities. The UK has 
existing strengths in sub-sectors which are likely to 
grow as a result of an ageing population, including:

  Medical technology (including the growing 
healthcare market for remote diagnosis, self-
testing and home-monitoring of medical 
conditions, and telecare): to enable people to 
maintain their independence and to manage 
complex health problems and disabilities;

  Pharmaceuticals and biosciences: to minimise or 

prevent the medical conditions of old age;
Food and drink: to respond to growing numbers 
of single person households and concerns about 
nutrition; and

 

  Automotive: to respond to drivers with limited 
capabilities, and the mobility needs of those no 
longer able to drive.

6.1.10 POTENTIAL  
HUMAN  
ENHANCEMENT 

‘Human enhancement’ encompasses a range of 
approaches which may be used to restore or 
improve aspects of human function such as memory, 
hearing and mobility, for purposes of either restoring 
an impaired function to previous or average levels, 
or to raise functionality to a level considered to be 
‘beyond the norm’ for humans. This may be achieved 
through technological means by cognitive enhancing 
drugs to improve memory and concentration, 
the use of aids and implants to improve sensory 
perception, and the use of bionic limbs to restore  
or enhance mobility. 

The development of enhancement technologies 
might offer economic opportunities for some 
sub-sectors of manufacturing. More broadly, 
enhancement technologies could change how 
people work along a spectrum from increasing 
participation among those people who might 
otherwise be disadvantaged, including some older 
people, to improving the efficiency of workers 
beyond the current limits of human capacity56. 

There are ethical, societal and political issues 
concerning the utilisation of human enhancement 
techniques and associated uncertainties about the 
extent to which human enhancement techniques 
will be used in the UK and elsewhere. They could for 
example be used to increase the competitiveness 
of the workforce and improve aspects of human 
functionality which tend to deteriorate with 
‘biological ageing’. These techniques could have 
important positive and negative implications for 
the future of manufacturing and the future of work 
more generally.

  Utilisation: Ensuring that manufacturers utilise 

future workers effectively. 

  Employer demand will need to be raised 

to stimulate a supply of skills which meets 
their needs as closely as possible. Employers 
also need to design jobs that enable the full 
utilisation of employee skills. Skills utilisation 
needs to receive greater attention.

6.2.1 INTRODUCTION

People will play an increasingly important role in 
the UK’s manufacturing competitiveness in the 
future, particularly in the context of important 
wider changes and uncertainties outlined above 
and in the previous chapters of this Report. These 
include jobless growth, the prospect of developed 
economies increasingly competing on the quality 
of their workforces, and changes in relative labour 
costs. There will also be growth in the number 
of professional roles, a demand for workers with 
‘hybrid’ skills, and continuing poor perception of 
manufacturing amongst young people and women. 
Ageing populations in the UK will also affect the 
workforce, and product demand. 

This section assesses the implications of these 
various changes and presents options for policy 
makers (see Figure 6.3). A key message is that 
current approaches to providing and utilising human 
capital for manufacturing activities will need to adapt 
and change. More UK manufacturing firms will need 
to move from a situation of ‘low skills equilibrium’57 
characterised by low value-added, low skills and 
low wages to a ‘high skills equilibrium’ characterised 
by high value-added, high skills and high wages. 
Deficiencies in management capability, discussed 
earlier, are also important here. 

6.2. IMPLICATIONS 
FOR GOVERNMENT

KEY MESSAGES
The future quantity, quality and utilisation 
of suitably skilled people will be crucial in 
ensuring the future competitiveness of the UK 
manufacturing sector. Recent government efforts 
to increase the number of apprenticeships, 
promote STEM skills, and help ensure the 
retention of talent in the manufacturing sector  
are all important steps in the right direction. 

The changes and uncertainties highlighted in this 
Report indicate three critically important areas 
which the UK will need to address to meet future 
human capital requirements in manufacturing. 
However the government needs to expand 
the scale and ambition of its current initiatives 
significantly.

Quantity: Increasing and diversifying the supply of 
manufacturing workers to avoid future shortfalls. 

  This will entail reaching out to young people in 
the education system consistently to encourage 
them to study STEM subjects to keep their 
future options open; a focus on accessing and 
attracting international talent; and building and 
maintaining existing workforce capability.

Quality: Equipping future workers with high quality 
‘hybrid’ skills (deep technical knowledge allied with 
generic skills and problem-solving capabilities) that 
manufacturers will need. 

  Potential workers will need to be as ‘business 
ready’ as possible, to meet the need for new 
skills sets driven by changing business models, 
technology and other factors. Higher level skills, 
vocational training, apprenticeships and STEM 
qualifications will play a critical role, particularly 
in meeting demand for workers in managerial, 
professional and technical roles.

DIVERSIFYING  
THE SUPPLY OF  
MANUFACTURING 
WORKERS TO AVOID 
FUTURE SHORTFALLS

(I) INTERVENTION IN THE 
EDUCATION SYSTEM – THE NEED 
TO REACH OUT CONSISTENTLY TO 
YOUNG PEOPLE

Compulsory education

The skills pipeline for the future manufacturing 
workforce begins with primary school children 
and young people, whose interest in manufacturing 
needs to be consistently sparked, captured, 
maintained and stimulated. Given the likely future 
demand for workers at apprentice, technician and 
degree level with STEM qualifications, greater effort 
needs to be made in reaching out to children at 
primary school to ensure that they are encouraged 

to study STEM subjects to keep their future career 
options open, and to stimulate their interest in 
science, design, and ‘how things are made and work’. 
The impact of careers advice is high at a young 
age and there is very considerable scope for the 
involvement of local employers in educational 
projects from primary school age58 onwards.

This interest needs to be maintained and/or re-  
stimulated at secondary school level through the 
promotion of science and engineering careers 
advice, and STEM-specific initiatives. Professional 
bodies, careers advisers, work experience, and 
contact with working people have important roles 
to play in providing information on manufacturing 
careers and apprenticeship opportunities (see 
Section 6.2.3). Recent initiatives such as the 
Government Inspiration Vision Statement59, which 
emphasises the importance of aspiration and 
inspiration being included within careers advice, are 
welcome, however the scale and coordination of 
current measures needs to be increased.

There have been concerns that the potential removal 
of the statutory duty on secondary schools to 
provide work experience60 will have a detrimental 
effect on the knowledge of young people about 
working in manufacturing, and the workplace in 
general. Furthermore, with changes in the provision 
of careers advice in England, it is unclear whether 
young people will be able to access quality face-
to-face careers advice to provide guidance about 
labour markets, and subject and careers choices61. 
Again there is scope for greater involvement of 
local employers with secondary schools, to advise 
on careers in manufacturing, and on the demands 
of recruiters. Partnerships with schools would 
also provide employers with greater insight into 
how they might contribute to stimulate interest in 
manufacturing amongst young people and help them 
to contribute to the development of knowledge and 
skills which manufacturing needs. It would be valuable 
for example to highlight how ‘factories of the future’ 
might develop, and the increasing importance of 
design skills, now and in the future.

and Skills (2011) 61 Science and Technology Committee (2013); National Careers Council (2013). 

6. Increasingly dependent on highly skilled workers 189

The ‘Make Things, Do Stuff’ campaign62 provides an 
example of how young people’s interest in digital 
media can be harnessed to encourage them to 
move beyond being passive users to use technology 
to ‘make things’. Progressive improvements in 
technology could also enhance students’ learning 
experiences. For example, there is scope to make 
greater use of e-learning to help provide a broader 
curriculum for young learners. 

It is particularly important to address the negative 
perception of manufacturing held by girls and 
young women, a point which was reinforced at the 
international project workshops63. Attracting more 
young women will increase the potential pool of 
workers on which manufacturing can draw and 
is likely to require initiatives and activities aimed 
specifically at girls as they make their subject choices. 
It is notable that most students studying STEM 
subjects do so because of interest and enjoyment  
in the subject or because of their aptitude64.

In general, there has been little formal evaluation 
of programmes and initiatives aimed at improving 
knowledge of, and promoting the image of, 
manufacturing in schools. Yet there is some evidence 
that the impacts of some initiatives have been 
positive. For example, the STEM Ambassadors 
programme works with 3,000 employers across 
the UK to create effective links with education, 
and reports there has been a positive impact 
on participating pupils’ motivations and attitudes 
towards STEM65. Over the last decade, there have 
been several national initiatives aimed at increasing 
the supply of STEM skills in schools, and higher 
education66. These have had some success, with 
numbers of students studying STEM subjects at 
degree level increasing by over 25% between 2002-
3 and 2009-10. This impetus needs to be maintained 
and enhanced in the future.

University level 

Maintenance and stimulation of interest in 
manufacturing careers needs to continue at 
university, particularly amongst students studying 
for degrees in STEM subjects, as this is when ideas 
about careers tend to crystallise. Career paths 
are neither simple nor predictable, as choosing 
to study a STEM subject does not translate by 
default into choosing, or gaining entry into a 
STEM job as highlighted earlier. There is evidence, 
however, that entering postgraduate study is often 
a deliberate path towards a STEM career67. This 
means that funding structures, including fees and 
loans for degrees at Masters level, need to be 
readily accessible to ensure that individuals are not 
deterred from postgraduate studies.

Because up to a quarter of STEM undergraduate 
students expect to take time out or enter 
temporary employment after graduation68, advice 
on deferring long-term career decisions needs to be 
provided. Evidence from surveys shows that most 
graduates value ‘interesting’ work; starting salary 
and prospective earnings is a key driver for only a 
minority of graduates who are almost exclusively 
male. Terms and conditions of work, and work-life 
balance issues more generally are also known to be 
important factors in attracting and keeping skilled 
workers69. These wider issues concerning experience 
of work, workforce diversity, worker autonomy and 
the intensity of work should not be overlooked in 
efforts to attract people to careers in manufacturing. 

Equipping graduates with relevant experience

One reason why some manufacturing employers 
are (re)turning to apprentices to fill associate 
professional and technical occupations is that they 
have the practical experience which is lacking 
in many graduates with theoretical knowledge. 
Sandwich courses and work experience placements 
in manufacturing help provide higher education 
students with relevant practical experience, increase 
their employability, and provide them with insights 
into what working in manufacturing entails. They 
are likewise valued by employers70.

(2013) 66 For example, the STEMNET programme aims to inspire young people by providing enrichment activities in science, technology, engineering and maths; 
while the HE STEM Programme provides support in attracting students to STEM subjects.  Other initiatives have focused on groups under-represented in STEM 
– notably girls and women 67 Mellors-Bourne, R., Connor, H. & Jackson, C. (2011) 68 Mellors-Bourne, R., Connor, H. & Jackson, C. (2011) 69 Evidence Paper 35:

6. Increasingly dependent on highly skilled workers 

Other potential workers 

Employers also need to be increasingly sensitive to 
the ways in which different population groups access 
information about employment opportunities, and 
encourage them to demonstrate their potential. 
This means giving greater consideration to where 
and how to advertise and the range of recruitment 
and selection methods used to attract a wide and 
diverse pool of people71. 

(II) ACCESSING AND ATTRACTING 
INTERNATIONAL TALENT

Looking out to 2050, it will become increasingly 
important for the UK to identify, access and attract 
people who are at the cutting edge of technological 
developments with ‘design-make’ expertise, to help 
maintain and raise national competitiveness72, 73. It 
seems likely that most of the future workforce will 
be drawn from the UK. However the UK will also 
need to identify external sources of skills which can 
be drawn upon when required to fill specific gaps 
in the future. The Migration Advisory Committee 
identifies a Shortage Occupation List for Tier 2 
of the Points-Based System and there are some 
specific engineering occupations included. The UK 
will therefore need to maintain and widen access 
to the large, diverse pool of international talent 
available. It might include, for example, facilitating the 
mobility of managers from countries with strong 
track records in leadership and management such  
as the US74. 

One way of increasing the UK’s future 
attractiveness to highly qualified people from 
outside the European Economic Area would be 
the re-introduction of the post-study work route 
for individuals undertaking Masters and PhD 
degrees in STEM subjects. This would require the 
introduction of ‘science visas’ for those offered 
post-doctoral research posts in engineering or 
science at recognised higher education institutions. 
Development of specific courses likely to be 
attractive to international, as well as to home 
students, is one option. As skills policies are typically 
designed nationally, but a growing number of 
employers operate internationally, future promotion 
of cross-border skills policies also makes sense. The 
position of English as the dominant world language 

of the internet is likely to be a strong factor in the 
UK attracting international talent. 

(III) BUILDING AND MAINTAINING 
WORKFORCE CAPABILITY

Continuing vocational education and training 

Developed economies are likely to compete on 
the quality of their workforces in the future, which 
means that skills policies need to help develop 
and maintain the capability of the manufacturing 
workforce. This requires an emphasis on increasing 
the demand for skills (see Section 6.2.4), addressing 
current and likely future skills gaps, and ensuring 
that skills are in place to exploit the opportunities 
associated with new technologies. 

While much of the debate on skills policy focuses 
on new entrants to manufacturing, and initial 
vocational education and training, the importance of 
continuing vocational education and training should 
not be underestimated since it will be needed 
throughout working lives. How work is organised 
and how jobs are designed are important factors for 
continuing vocational education and training, given 
their role in facilitating workplace learning and in the 
process of workplace innovation75. E-learning may 
also play an expanding role in updating workers’ 
skills in the future, particularly for people working in 
SMEs or remote locations.

The example of Balmoral Offshore Engineering 
(see Box 6.2) shows how one employer has taken 
responsibility for developing a skilled workforce 
by bringing together existing employees and new 
recruits to address skills shortages and ensure 
workforce capability. This is consistent with the 
approach which is likely to be needed in the future.

The UK’s lacklustre performance in terms of 
leadership and management capabilities will need 
to be addressed out to 2050 for the UK to remain 
competitive. Some progress is being made in this 
area, for example through the Growth Accelerator 
which provides access to up to £2000 of matched 
funding for senior managers to develop their 
leadership and management skills.

BOX 6.2: THE ROLE OF AN IN-HOUSE 
ACADEMY IN ADDRESSING SKILLS 
REQUIREMENTS: THE EXAMPLE OF 
BALMORAL OFFSHORE ENGINEERING
Balmoral Offshore Engineering is a deepwater 
buoyancy, insulation and elastomer product specialist. 
To address skills shortages the company has invested 
in the ‘Balmoral Skills Academy’ at its Aberdeen 
headquarters to provide hands-on training for 
production process leaders. The company appointed 
a qualified trainer and registered assessor and 
sought accreditation from the Scottish Qualifications 
Authority to gain accreditation as an approved 
training centre. The first group of candidates for a 
six-month training programme, leading to a Scottish 
Vocational Qualification at Level 2 in ‘Performing 
Manufacturing Operations’, were selected from 
existing employees and new recruits on the basis 
of interviews and psychometric assessment. The 
course is designed to provide structured training 
and in-depth understanding of Balmoral-specific 
manufacturing operations, while providing the 
trainee with a nationally recognised qualification.

The ageing of the UK workforce will also create a 
need for lifelong learning as well as initial training. 
Manufacturing apprenticeships tend to be focused 
disproportionately on young people who have just 
completed full-time education. Evidence from case 
studies shows that, apprenticeships in manufacturing 
are highly structured, training intensive, and costly 
programmes which are rarely used to up-skill or 
accredit the skills of existing employees76. This youth 
centred strategy needs to diversify. Evidence from 
Australia and the Netherlands on the development 
of intermediate level skills and apprenticeships 
suggests that modularised and competence based 
systems are more flexible than curricula based 
systems (as in Germany), and are better attuned 
to the inclusion of intermediate vocational training 
for adult learners77. A modular system helps to 
improve the flexibility of training pathways and the 
development of ‘hybrid’ skills. 

Valuing older workers

In the UK, those employed in skilled trades and 
associated professional jobs have an older than 
average age profile78, 79. As individuals retire, 
employers cannot always resort to the external 
labour market to recruit individuals with similar 

skills, as the pool from which they are likely to be 
recruiting is getting older and smaller. The retirement 
of existing workers, along with workers moving to 
jobs in other sectors, is an important element of the 
challenge faced by UK manufacturing of filling nearly 
800,000 jobs by 2020 (see Section 6.1). 

Multiple approaches are needed to maintain and 
enhance a high quality workforce. To do otherwise 
would be to risk the future competitiveness of 
UK manufacturing. Apprenticeship training and 
other vocational training will need to be bolstered 
further to help address these ‘replacement demand’ 
requirements. Enhanced diversity in recruitment to 
manufacturing, from the UK and internationally will 
also play a role. But since few jobs are considered 
beyond the capacity of the average 70 year old80, 
encouraging older workers to delay retirement may 
provide extra time in which to prepare, while also 
making efficient use of skills and tacit knowledge. 
This aspect is important as a lack of certification 
of qualifications amongst older workers can be 
a problem if they lose their jobs, as experience 
and knowledge can be overlooked. With early 
retirement schemes in decline, the abolition of the 
default retirement age, and an increase in the age of 
eligibility for the state pension, working longer may 
be attractive for some individuals. 

Employers can encourage retention of older 
workers through implementing a variety of age 
management policies covering work organisation, 
mobility management, task design, working time 
arrangements (especially enabling flexible working 
arrangements), and continuing training including 
knowledge transfer. Lifelong learning and targeted 
training, especially in mid-career, can improve 
employability in later life and discourage early 
withdrawal from the labour market. 

‘Second chance’ pathways 

Individuals who are not currently working or who 
are unemployed could form part of the potential 
future workforce for manufacturing. Some of these 
people have relevant skills for manufacturing, or 
could develop existing skills to make them more 
relevant to manufacturing. More attention needs 
to be paid to encouraging people with relevant 
skills into manufacturing activities, which could be 
part of the solution to meeting skills requirements.

Giernalczyk, H. & Stock, L. (2012). 78 Mason, G. (2012) 79 Jagger, N., Sigala, M., & Sumption, F. 80 Evidence Paper 23:  McNair, S. (2013). 

192

Maintaining ‘ports of entry’ at various stages of workers’ 
careers, and ‘second chance’ pathways for them to 
develop skills and pursue careers, will enable flows into 
manufacturing and help develop a diverse workforce.

ADVICE FOR POLICY MAKERS:
Strengthening pre-16 science and engineering  
careers advice

There is a strong case for a statutory duty to remain 
on schools to provide work experience, and for 
science and engineering to be promoted to a 
greater extent through careers advisers when pupils 
are making subject choices. There is also scope for 
employers to create stronger links with primary and 
secondary schools, potentially via the Make it in Great 
Britain campaign81, for example to form relationships 
with local schools.

Making STEM PhDs more attractive

To provide the high level knowledge and expertise 
important for manufacturing activities, more university 
graduates need to be attracted to a career in 
manufacturing. Given the evidence that entering 
postgraduate study is often a deliberate path to a 
STEM career, funding structures for postgraduate 
degrees need to be made simple to navigate and 
access, with PhD students studying STEM subjects 
eligible for additional government remuneration. 

Equipping graduates with relevant experience 
through sandwich courses and project placements 

There is value in encouraging employers to provide 
a greater number of STEM-related work experience 
opportunities or ‘sandwich’ project placements for 
students. This would enable students to make a 
more informed choice about what a STEM-related 
career in manufacturing might offer. There is already 
some availability of these courses and programmes 
across the UK. However a stronger message from 
Government about their importance would help 
establish these courses.

Immigration policy that allows the UK to compete 
successfully for global skills          

UK manufacturing activities are likely to benefit from 
future immigration policies that are sensitive to the 
international competition for global skills. Changes 
to immigration rules mean that some employers 
face difficulties in sourcing some of their skills 
requirements internationally, with implications for 
UK competitiveness. The attractiveness of the UK to 
international skilled workers will be judged, in part, on 
the basis of how welcoming (or otherwise) future UK 
immigration policy is, in comparison to the policies of 
the UK’s competitors.

Promotion of cross-border skills policies

Skills policies are typically designed nationally. However, 
as UK manufacturing activities are likely to continue 
having international operations82 the promotion of 
cross-border skills policies is likely to be beneficial. 
These might include investing in skills outside the  
UK; encouraging international students to stay  
in the UK and utilise their skills; and encouraging  
more international exchanges involving UK higher 
education students.

Encouraging continuing vocational education and 
training, particularly for older workers

It will be important for public agencies to be involved 
in setting and maintaining standards for rigorous 
modularised and competence based training, including 
e-learning. In addition, policies to increase the availability 
of flexible working and training have a role in helping 
manufacturing businesses to compete for workers. 

Appreciating the importance of workplace 
configuration

Policies to promote ergonomic workplace 
configurations are likely to have particular benefits for 
older workers, but are likely to be beneficial for other 
workers too. Policies to promote greater interest 
and appreciation in standards of workplace design, to 
promote healthy workplaces that are conducive to 
workplace co-operation, learning and innovation at 
work, have the potential to yield economic and social 
benefits, for organisations and individuals.

6. Increasingly dependent on highly skilled workers 193

It will therefore be essential to ensure that there is 
a stock and flow of suitably qualified people with 
‘hybrid’ skills [i.e. a deep vertical technical knowledge 
allied with a broad transversal set of generic skills 
and problem-solving capabilities], as businesses seek 
to balance their investment in skills and automation 
across the manufacturing sector85. Manufacturing 
activities will in the future will increasingly require  
a mix of skills to perform a particular group of tasks 
and to provide a base for broader learning and 
progression86 which meets employer needs. 

(II) MEETING THE NEED FOR NEW 
SKILLS SETS

In addition to the focus on high value goods 
requiring workers to have a greater mix of 
complementary skills, changes in future business 
models (see Chapter 2) and in other areas including 
advances in technologies will all change the type of 
skills that will be required in the next decade and 
beyond. Each of these factors is considered in turn.

Product cycles and skills needs

Skill needs at all organisational levels change over 
time in response to factors including product 
market position, the development of products 
over the lifecycle, product complexity, and market 
demand (Table 6.4)83. Evidence84 suggests that UK 
manufacturing activity will be increasingly concentrated 
on high value goods, which is likely to be reflected 
in an increased demand for employees with high 
level skills, including workers with undergraduate and 
postgraduate degrees, and project management skills 
to bring new products to market.

PRODUCT COMPLEXITY

High value goods
Highly complex products that consist of many 
components in a market with uncertainty,

The future of manufacturing: A new era of opportunity and challenge for the UK194

Future business models

The new business models that will develop over 
the next four decades will necessitate a workforce 
with a different mix of skills. Engineers are likely to 
need to be able to facilitate increasing amounts of 
collaboration between different factories, with the 
demand for mixes of technical and non-technical 
skills likely to increase further as servitisation 
becomes widespread.

The shift towards the circular economy (see Chapter 
5) will involve greater collaboration between factories 
with different specialisms, and between factories and 
other organisations. For example, a shift to more 
urban manufacturing may help facilitate greater 
interaction between factories and schools. Some 
employees are likely to spend most of their time 
developing solutions to enable effective collaboration 
with other firms or institutions. In addition, the 
manufacturing workforce will not only need the skills 
to create products from raw materials, but also the 
skills to identify problems with finished products and 
repair or re-manufacture them. 

The increasing trend towards servitisation of 
the manufacturing sector will not only require a 
workforce with hybrid skills but a greater share  
of employees involved in non-production and  
non-technical roles. Customer-focused skills will  
be in increasing demand. Employers will need  
to make clear to potential employees that a  
diversity of roles will become increasingly available 
within manufacturing.

Future technologies

Technological developments such as the full 
integration of ICT and sensors, and the growing use 
of additive manufacturing will require a workforce 
that is adept at both analysing vast quantities of data 
and focussing on design. Firms will need to employ 
and train design engineers who can help enable 
reconfigurable factories of the future to produce a 
wider range of products (see Chapter 3). 

As the amount of data available to firms and 
customers increases, the most competitive firms 
will hire teams with computing skills and expertise 
in data management. Government can help ensure 

that these capabilities are developed throughout the 
education and training system. For example, STEM 
degrees could have a ‘data management’ component.

The need to encourage the rapid movement of 
technologies through technology readiness levels 
(TRLs) from concept to product (see Chapter 3)  
has implications for the education system and 
for workforce skills. Courses that provide an 
opportunity to develop a combination of cutting 
edge scientific and entrepreneurial expertise need 
to be more commonplace in the future. One 
example that has been particularly attractive to 
international talent is shown in Box 6.3. 

BOX 6.3: BUILDING AND BRIDGING 
ACADEMIC AND COMMERCIAL SKILLS  
WITH INTERNATIONAL TALENT: THE 
EXAMPLE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF 
CAMBRIDGE MASTER’S IN BIOSCIENCE 
ENTERPRISE (MBE)
This MBE programme is a science and business 
‘professional practice course’ designed for 
graduates with a degree in biological, medical, 
physical or engineering sciences or a financial or 
legal background who have the ambition to found 
technology companies or take leading roles in 
the life science sector. Based at the Institute of 
Biotechnology at the University of Cambridge, 
the course offers opportunities for students to 
work with world-class academics and experienced 
entrepreneurs, with learning experiences based on 
real life business scenarios and case studies. The 
focus is on how bioscience businesses are created, 
funded and successfully developed.

Since the course was founded in 2002, there have 
been nearly 1,500 applications for places on the 
course, with 251 students admitted. The course has 
an international reach: of those admitted 61 were 
from the UK, 49 from the rest of the EU, 37 from 
the US and 104 from the rest of the world. 47% of 
MBE graduates have remained as taxpayers in the 
UK. To date, at least 18 new company start-ups have 
been founded by participants on the course.

and knowledge transfer between HE and industry are 
likely to become more important. 

Greater business sponsorship of PhD students would 
provide a stronger industry pull for research, and will 
help ensure that graduates and other educational 
leavers are equipped with the skills required for future 
manufacturing environments. Given higher levels of 
student debt in recent years, business sponsorship 
would be particularly helpful. However, it is unlikely to 
be sufficient, and in sectors of strategic importance 
such as manufacturing, there is a case for central 
government funding for postgraduate courses to 
safeguard the volume of graduates coming out of HE 
programmes. Some significant progress is being made 
in this area, for example through the EPSRC Centres 
for Doctoral Training (see Box 6.4). However further 
effort is needed to ensure that the UK does not fall 
further behind its competitors in the provision of 
STEM graduates. 

BOX 6.4: EPSRC CENTRES FOR  
DOCTORAL TRAINING89 
These Centres bring together diverse areas of 
expertise to train engineers and scientists in a 
specific research area or theme. Training includes 
technical and transferrable skills training, as well 
as a research element. They are funded mainly 
by government, although many Centres leverage 
additional studentships from other sources. A subset 
of the Centres, called Industrial Doctorate Centres, 
provide an alternative to the traditional PhD for 
students who want a career in industry. Here a 
four-year programme combines PhD-level research 
projects with taught courses, and students spend 
about 75 per cent of their time working directly 
with a company.

More generally, effective government engagement 
is required to stimulate future co-investment 
with employers and individuals in high level skills 
in specialist sectors. The nuclear sector is a good 
example of this situation (see Box 6.5).

Future environmental changes

As demand for natural resources rises and accessibility 
decreases, manufacturers will need to increase the 
resource efficiency of their processes. However, this 
may not be sufficient when looking out over four 
decades (see Chapter 5). Greater resource efficiency 
will need to be supplemented by the development 
and use of novel materials and where possible, the 
utilisation of locally available materials. This shift has 
implications for the type of R&D which will need to 
be funded and the skills requirements of researchers 
within academic institutions and industry.

Environmental trends will create a growing need for 
research scientists and engineers not only in more 
traditional fields such as material science, chemistry 
and bio-chemistry, but in newer fields for example 
green chemistry, and in fields such as bioengineering 
which cut across the natural and physical sciences. 
Cross-cutting degrees with greater multi-disciplinarity 
are likely to become increasingly important in providing 
people with the necessary breadth and depth of 
technical understanding.

Future markets

As emerging economies continue to grow, 
manufacturing firms will need to take advantage 
of new markets. In particular, firms will need to be 
able to identify where opportunities will arise, and 
acquire relevant cultural understanding to develop 
long-lasting customer relationships. However, the 
currently inadequate language skills and associated 
cultural understanding amongst many native English 
speakers may place UK manufacturers at an increasing 
disadvantage in manufacturing businesses operating 
on a global basis, and in SMEs seeking export sales87. 
At the same time, foreign direct investment (FDI) into 
Europe as a proportion of worldwide FDI is set to 
decrease88. Firms will require a number of capabilities 
to draw in as much investment as possible from future 
markets into the UK. 

Higher level skills

Given the growing significance of higher level skills in 
manufacturing, particularly graduate and postgraduate 
skills, it is vital that the higher education (HE) sector is 
able to provide sufficient numbers of suitably qualified 
graduates and postgraduates with academic, technical 
and practical skills. Policies which facilitate collaboration

BOX 6.5: EFFECT OF THE PROSPECT OF 
NUCLEAR ENERGY DEPLOYMENT ON 
STUDENT INTEREST
The government decision to encourage energy 
companies to build new nuclear power plants in 
2006 represented a turning point for UK energy 
policy90, indicating opportunities for UK businesses 
to be involved as part of the supply chain with the 
creation of new jobs to build and run the new plant. 
A critical issue is to ensure a workforce with the 
necessary skills and knowledge, given previous policy 
uncertainty in a sector where there are long lead 
times for training and building experience. 

There are promising signs that at postgraduate  
level, student interest in acquiring necessary skills  
is responsive to perceived opportunities. The Physics, 
Technology and Nuclear Reactors Masters course  
at the University of Birmingham has been in 
operation since 1956. There is a strong correlation 
between the perception of opportunities in the 
nuclear industry and the entry numbers for the 
course. The government decision in 2006 is likely  
to be the main stimulus for a rise in applications,  
with further increases expected as new nuclear  
build is encouraged.

A significant proportion of current funding for 
students comes from industry, with students funding 
the remainder. The level of industrial support which 
students receive depends on degree class obtained. 
As national postgraduate tuition fees rise, industry 
support may need to rise in tandem to avoid the 
risk of discouraging students from applying. 

There is also growing interest at the undergraduate 
level with the University of Birmingham introducing 
an undergraduate programme in Nuclear 
Engineering (MEng, with a BSc counterpart) 
and an MSc in Nuclear Waste Management and 
Decommissioning. When these are up to capacity 
they will deliver around 100 students a year to the 
nuclear sector91. 

Vocational training and the role of apprenticeships

Initial vocational education through apprenticeships 
is a critical pathway for delivering intermediate 
level skills. The continuing promotion of the 
‘apprenticeship’ brand, which has been stronger  
in engineering than in many other sectors, helps  
to raise the profile of intermediate skills which  
are important to manufacturing now, and are likely 
to remain so in the future. Evidence92, 93, 94 suggests 
that employers find that the combination of  
theory and practice provided by apprenticeships  
is beneficial for their businesses. They deliver  
the skills employers need and provide a cadre  
of skilled workers from which future supervisors  
and managers can be selected. 

Although manufacturing employers encounter 
relatively high costs in providing apprenticeships 
compared with other non-manufacturing sectors, 
they can be recouped soon after training if the 
employer can retain apprentices after completion95. 
Consequently apprenticeships offer advantages 
both to employers who obtain the skills they need, 
and to apprentices who obtain relatively good 
returns in wages and being in employment96, 97. The 
opportunity to earn whilst learning is an increasingly 
attractive option to young people particularly with 
higher HE fees and when there is potential to 
progress on to Higher Apprenticeships98, 99.

The 2012 Richard Review of Apprenticeships100 
highlighted the need for an emphasis on the 
‘quality’ of apprenticeships. It argued that employers 
should design apprenticeships to meet the future 
requirements for their industry, with employers 
and government safeguarding quality. This is likely 
to mean that ‘islands of excellence’ are produced101 
where some of the large manufacturing firms have 
excellent provision. The challenge is how to get 
greater demand for apprenticeships from a wider 
spectrum of employers, especially SMEs, to create 
a coherent, sustainable and widely distributed 
capacity for skill formation in young people. There

(2012b). 95 At the high value end of the spectrum estimates indicate that it costs Rolls-Royce approximately £90,000 to put an individual through a three-
year Advanced Apprenticeship course, with approximate levels of Government funding for the total programme being about £16,000 for 16-19 year olds 
and £9,000 for 19-24 year olds. Other case study evidence on the net costs of training from the ‘Fifth Net Benefits of Training to Employers Survey’ suggests 
that the net cost for an Engineering Apprentice at Level 2 and 3 combined is £39,600, which is more than in other sectors. The payback period for a Level 
3 Engineering Apprentice is 3 years and 7 months.  (For further details see Hogarth T., Gambin L., Winterbotham M., Baldauf B., Briscoe G., Gunstone B.,

and develop the next range of high value 
products105.

Education and training systems need to equip 
employers and workers with ‘t-shaped’ or ‘hybrid’ skills, 
to ensure they become agile in management, market 
and technical terms. This can be achieved by ensuring 
the coverage of STEM courses is refreshed regularly  
to ensure that employer needs are being met.

Supporting higher level skills by facilitating 
academic-industry collaboration

Considerable progress has been made in recent 
decades in strengthening UK academic-industry 
links, with the National Centre for Universities and 
Business launched in 2013. However, a great deal 
remains to be done. Greater emphasis is needed on 
policies which facilitate collaboration and knowledge 
transfer between universities and industry. One 
obvious step is greater business sponsorship of PhD 
students, with the role of SMEs outside major supply 
chains given special consideration to avoid important 
areas of knowledge transfer being overlooked.

It is worth noting that in the US, community 
colleges play an important role acting as a hub 
for careers coaches and stakeholders to create 
education, training and employment pathways 
into manufacturing. The Government response to 
Sir Andrew Witty’s review into universities and 
growth106 will provide a potential opportunity to 
strengthen academic-industry collaboration.

Resourcing

The level of resource needed for engineering 
students is relatively high compared with many 
other subjects, given the access they require to  
high performance computers and other equipment. 
HE funding policy needs to ensure that resources 
are protected in the future, and are at a level  
that is at least comparable with those of the  
UK’s competitors.

is a role for large employers in manufacturing to 
stimulate demand from SMEs which face constraints 
in cost and capacity in providing training. There are 
also other models. These include Group Training 
Associations, which are formal partnerships funded 
through a membership fee, where employers 
come together to address common business 
service, recruitment and/or training challenges102. 
Such Group Training Associations can help 
employers navigate the complexity of the current 
apprenticeship system103.

ADVICE FOR POLICY MAKERS:

Raising the quality of vocational training 

The ‘quality’ of apprenticeships needs to be 
emphasised104. A critical future challenge is how 
to get greater demand for apprenticeships from 
a wider spectrum of employers, especially SMEs, 
to create a coherent, sustainable and widely 
distributed capacity.

In England the current development of 
‘apprenticeship hubs’ as part of the City Deals 
initiative may help catalyse new apprenticeships 
in small businesses. Local Enterprise Partnerships 
also have an ongoing role to play in promoting 
apprenticeships and other vocational training  
to meet local skills needs as part of local  
skills strategies. 

Anticipating the demand for future  
manufacturing skills 

As requirements for human capital shifts towards 
more hybrid skills and more workers in highly skilled 
jobs, it will be essential for Government and others 
to anticipate future demand and communicate the 
requirements across skills providers. 

Equipping workers to become and remain agile in 
keeping pace with changing technologies, products, 
and markets

The future manufacturing workforce will need to be 
agile enough to:

adapt to changing market positions of goods 
(i.e. develop systems which accommodate mass 
production if a product shifts from a ‘high value 
good’ to a commodity);

Improving UK capability in language skills and 
inter-cultural understanding

Policies promoting language skills in Mandarin, 
Spanish, Hindi and Arabic, which are set to be 
amongst the most widely spoken languages 
worldwide in 2050, alongside technical and business 
skills, are likely to benefit UK manufacturing activities 
by helping businesses enter new markets107. A 
‘languages for business’ element to the National 
Curriculum would be one way of rising to this 
challenge. MBA courses that ensure competence in 
more than one language (for example the London 
Business School MBA course108) are another.

6.2.4 UTILISATION: 
ENSURING THAT 
MANUFACTURERS 
UTILISE FUTURE 
WORKERS  
EFFECTIVELY

The manufacturing workforce in the UK will need to 
be more diverse in the future. Development of the 
necessary skills in the decades ahead will be critical. 
In driving these changes employers should not only 
aim to benefit themselves but wider society, by 
providing sufficient demand for the new skills that 
will be available and by providing interesting, well 
designed job opportunities. 

(I) RAISING EMPLOYERS’ DEMAND  
FOR SKILLS

Stimulating demand

Traditionally, skills policy has tended to focus on the 
supply of skills. Now demand side issues (i.e. how 
employers develop and use skills) are increasingly 
recognised as being equally significant109; a position 
reinforced by the OECD’s Skills Strategy (2012)110 111. 
This policy message needs to be promoted to 
stimulate demand for skills in manufacturing, and to 
ensure that employers maximise utilisation of the 
skills of existing workforces, and that investments in 
skills are put to optimal use112. 

Understanding future skills needs

If employers are to be competitive in the short-
term and capitalise on medium to long-term 
future opportunities, it is critical that they are as 
clear as possible about their future skills needs. 
These requirements need to be communicated 
effectively to the education sector, training providers 
and individuals. This need for concerted action 
highlights the continued importance of Government 
coordinating the skills landscape across compulsory 
education, further education, vocational education 
and higher education113. 

Government policy needs to be sensitive to the 
need for stability and simplicity within the skills 
system to secure employer engagement, increase 
familiarity with different types of qualifications, and 
to advise and guide organisations on navigating the 
system. This is especially so given the future role of 
Government as an ‘enabler’ increasingly empowering 
employers, individuals, and learning providers to 
work better together through promoting employers 
demand for skills, individual ambition and responsive 
provision, rather than to act as a ‘provider’114.

To enhance responsiveness to future requirements 
for skills, manufacturing employers would benefit 
from strengthening their knowledge of skills 
which are currently available, and skills likely to 
become available in the future. This survey would 
need to include workers within the organisation, 
subcontractors within the supply chain, and external 
sources of skills which might be drawn on when 
necessary. Once they have assessed internal and 
external potential sources of workers, employers 
will need to plan ahead to determine gaps between 
available and required skills, and identify strategies to 
develop, populate and implement skills pipelines to 
counter future shortages115 116. The challenge will be 
to ensure necessary organisational ability to access 
skills when they are required.

Defining the skills pipeline in manufacturing 
businesses

There is a strong case for Government to 
encourage manufacturing employers to assess their 
own skills pipelines to identify expected future 
shortfalls, potentially through the Manufacturing 
Advisory Service.

Raising demand for skills

Demand side skills issues, including how employers 
develop and use skills, are becoming more 
important. For the future, local and national skills 
strategies need to take account of the need to raise 
the demand for skills, alongside the supply of skills, 
especially at higher levels.

Focusing on developing and using skills

Skills policies have the potential to play a critical 
role in helping employers to optimise utilisation of 
existing workforces. Examples include encouraging 
work to be redesigned where possible to give 
workers the ability to use a wider range of skills, and 
modifying jobs to ensure they make best use of skills 
available in the workforce.

requirements, they can potentially be supported in 
using this knowledge to design jobs which people 
will want and where they can maximise use of their 
skills. There is a general lack of evaluation of policies 
for skills utilisation, but there is some evidence that 
policies have had a positive impact in the industries 
in which they have been implemented117. Research 
also suggests that the way in which jobs are 
designed, in terms of the complexity of tasks and 
the level of autonomy and discretion afforded to 
workers, has a significant bearing on the scope that 
workers have to develop and deploy their skills in 
the workplace118.

There is growing interest in skills utilisation in policy 
discourse 119 120 121. Effective skills utilisation concerns 
confident, motivated and relevantly skilled individuals 
who are aware of the skills they possess and how 
best to use them. It also focuses on workplaces 
which provide meaningful and appropriate 
encouragement, opportunity and support for 
employees to use their skills effectively to increase 
performance and productivity, improve job 
satisfaction and employee well-being, and stimulate 
investment, enterprise and innovation122. A coherent 
approach to the most effective application of skills 
in the workplace to maximise performance in the 
future would involve the interplay of employers, 
employees, sector bodies, education and training 
providers and government, and the use of a range 
of HR, management and working practices. 

ADVICE FOR POLICY MAKERS:

The Employer Ownership of Skills agenda

The future role of government will increasingly be 
to stimulate employer demand, individual aspiration 
and a responsive provision of learning and skills 
development, rather than to provide funding 
per se. This role entails provision of information 
for individuals on projected future employment 
opportunities, skills requirements and pay levels, and 
involves employers making their current and future 
skills requirements as clear as possible to individuals 
and training providers. Pricing signals, incentives 
and strategic leadership are needed to encourage 
a more skills intensive economy, in which workers 
with a range of skills are capable of responding 
creatively to diverse opportunities in the future.

7. Systemic areas for Government focus: Priorities and next steps

Introduction: Future challenges and opportunities 
for UK manufacturing

The UK manufacturing sector now accounts for a 
significantly smaller proportion of the UK economy’s 
output than it did 30 years ago and it employs 
significantly fewer people. These trends, whilst apparent 
in developed economies including the US, France and 
Germany, have been more marked in the UK. 

UK manufacturing also compares poorly to key 
competitors, in terms of expenditure on capital 
investment, and research and development. Around 
a half of manufacturing R&D in the UK is carried out 
by overseas controlled multinationals and compared 
to other major economies, UK manufacturing R&D 
as a whole is far more reliant on overseas funding. 
These characteristics are important, given:

  The powerful contributions that the 

manufacturing sector can make to an economy 
by stimulating innovation, achieving high levels 
of productivity, leading in exports and providing 
high quality jobs; and 

  That manufacturing will enter a dynamic new 

phase in the decades ahead, as it is transformed 
by global forces and competition intensifies for 
flows of foreign direct investment and where 
manufacturing is located (see Box 7.1). 

Without action from policy makers and 
manufacturers, there is a high risk that the UK will 
fail to capitalise on substantial new opportunities for 
creating future value. Inaction will also risk further 
reductions in the relative size of this sector of the 
economy with its vital and complementary links to 
other sectors.

This Report provides advice for Government 
and industry on four future characteristics of 
manufacturing, each of which will present a wide 
range of opportunities for UK manufacturers:

 

1. 

2. 

3. 
4. 

 Faster, more responsive and closer to 
customers (Chapter 3)
 Exposed to new market opportunities 
(Chapter 4)
 More sustainable (Chapter 5)
 Increasingly dependent on highly skilled 
workers (Chapter 6) 

Manufacturing will be subject to rapid and pervasive 
technological change, transforming business models 
and increasing the complexity of manufacturing 
value chains, with production remaining centrally 
important. This Report argues that these 
transformations, which will affect manufacturing in 
the UK over the next three decades, require a much 
more systemic approach to policy making. This will 
require innovation in metrics to capture changes 
in the scale and nature of manufacturing activity 
as a key input into policy development. It will also 
require Government to invest in the enhancement 
of policy makers’ capacity to both understand and 
design policy in specific sectoral and technological 
contexts and take a cross-departmental, long-term 
and consistent approach to policy intervention.  
The following three areas are put forward as 
‘systemic’ future priorities for Government: 

  Taking a more integrated view of value creation 

in the manufacturing system: New metrics that go 
beyond measuring production output would be 
an important first step in assessing how value is 
being created in new ways, and how manufacturing 
connects with other parts of the economy.

  Adapting industrial policy to take a systems 

approach, allowing better targeting of specific 
stages of the manufacturing value chain: New 
measures are suggested in this report which 
would be informed by the new metrics and 
a ‘systems-based’ approach to the design of 
interventions, tailored to specific emerging 
technologies, and specific manufacturing sub-
sectors. A ‘systems-based approach’ to industrial 
policy would also emphasise the linkages and 
overlaps between science, technology and 
innovation policies; make it easier to identify 
potential unintended consequences of policies, 
and identify areas where intervention would 
achieve the greatest impact. 
Enhancing Government capability in evaluating 
and coordinating policy over the long term: 
Policies across government have direct and 
indirect effects on the manufacturing sector, 
which are often felt over many years. It is 
vital that in introducing and developing policy, 
a long-term perspective is adopted which 
matches long-term commitments in terms of 
investment, and research and development 
which the private sector must make to grasp 
the opportunities ahead. UK governments must 
enhance their capability to identify which policies 

203

work best in the long-term in a diverse range 
of manufacturing sub-sectors. It is also essential 
that policy is maintained in a consistent way over 
time. There are examples from other countries 

which suggest that one option to ensure long-
term consistency in policy development and 
applications would be to create a UK ‘Office  
for Manufacturing’ (see Section 7.3).

Box 7.1: the chanGinG nature of  
the manufacturinG Sector
As outlined in earlier chapters, in the decades ahead 
manufacturing will become:

Faster, more responsive and closer to customers:
Advances in technologies including sensors, additive 
manufacturing and ICT will ‘digitise’ manufacturing.  
It will take place closer to the customer, with a much 
greater range of products becoming more ‘personalised’ 
and tailored to specific needs. Factories of the future 
will be more diverse in their scale, with potential 
for mobile and home manufacturing. Government 
will need to ensure that UK manufacturers are able 
to take advantage of the technological revolution in 
how products are designed, made, offered, used and 
recycled. In particular, there is a strong case for better 
overall coordination of the technology pipe line for 
manufacturing technology (see Chapter 3). 

Exposed to new market opportunities and challenges: 
BRIC economies are likely to become larger than  
the US by 2015 and the G7 by 2032. Current  
markets for UK manufacturers, including the US and 
Europe, will continue to be important. Demand for 
products will change in response to ageing populations 
and changing levels of personal wealth in developed 
and emerging economies. At the same time, some  
new foreign investments in manufacturing are likely  
to be drawn away from Europe. Government will  
need to ensure that UK manufacturers are prepared  
to adapt to a world of increasingly fierce competition 
for trade, inward investment, and controlling value 
chains. Government will also need to work to 
address areas of current underperformance and 
underinvestment, including exporting by large firms, 
capital investment, and R&D (see Chapter 4). 

More sustainable: 
Increasing competition for resources is likely to result 
in greater price volatility in commodities. Successful 
manufacturers will significantly reduce inputs (for 
example materials and energy) while increasing the 
value to the customer. They will also place much 
greater emphasis on new ways of doing business, such 
as moving to a ‘circular economy’ model, with ‘end of 
life’ products either re-manufactured or used as inputs 
to the production process. Government will need 
to support manufacturers in their drive for resource 
efficiency and as they experiment with new ways of 
doing business (see Chapter 5). 

Increasingly dependent on highly skilled workers:
Manufacturers in developed economies will increasingly 
use the quality of their workforces to compete in high 
value manufacturing activities. Ensuring access to high 
quality workers with science, technology, engineering 
and mathematics (STEM) qualifications and deep 
technical knowledge combined with strong commercial 
awareness, will be important. Government will need 
to increase the scale and ambition of its current 
programmes to ensure sufficient quantity, quality  
and utlilisation of future manufacturing workers  
(see Chapter 6). 

Much more than just making a product and selling it:
New revenue streams are being created as 
manufacturers make use of a wider ‘value chain’ 
embracing R&D, production, services and other 
activities. For example, 39% of UK manufacturers 
derived value from ‘manufacturing services’ in 2011 
compared to 24% on 2007. Other new ways of doing 
business include becoming ‘factoryless goods producers’ 
who design and sell products but who outsource 
production. Government will need to play a central role 
in helping manufacturers adapt to new ways of doing 
business and controlling value chains (see Chapter 2).

inteGrated  
view of value  
creation in the  
manufacturinG 
Sector

Manufacturing is no longer just about ‘production’ – 
making a product and then selling it. Manufacturers 
are increasingly using a wider ‘value chain’ to 
generate new and additional revenue from pre- and 
post-production activities, with production playing 
a critical role in allowing these other activities to 
occur. For example, 39% of UK manufacturers 
with 100 or more employees derived value from 
‘manufacturing services’ related to their products in 
2011, compared to 24% in 20071. Future sources of 
new and additional revenue for manufacturers are 
likely to include the following2: 

 

Selling services in combination with products 
much more extensively;

  Using products to generate new information 
about consumers and the usage of products;

  Becoming ‘factoryless goods producers’, 
capturing value by selling technological 
knowledge and leaving production to others;
Shifting to a ‘circular economy’ way of 
doing business, with end of life products 
re-manufactured and returned to original 
specifications or better;

 

  Adapting to changing patterns of product 

ownership, by providing more robust products 
for ‘collaborative consumption’ amongst 
customers as opposed to outright ownership  
of a product;
Forming strategic alliances with manufacturers 
in the same and different sub-sectors, leading to 
collaborative communities which may become 
more significant in manufacturing activity than 
networks dominated by lead firms; and

 

  Using operational capabilities combined with 

greater entrepreneurial insight to respond rapidly 
to technological developments. 

New metrics will capture the novel ways in which 
manufacturers are creating value, and reveal the 
scale and location of important changes within 
the sector (see Box 7.2). These will be critical in 
revealing key interconnections in the economy, 
and helping identify where in the value chain 
future policy intervention should focus to support 
manufacturers as they create and capture new and 
additional revenue streams.

Box 7.2: meaSurinG manufacturinG 
The performance of the manufacturing sector is 
currently measured by classifying the output of 
manufacturing firms by the main type of economic 
activity in which they are engaged3, with the ONS 
using the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 
system. This provides a limited and incomplete 
picture since it fails to capture the wider 
manufacturing value chain or the incorporation  
of pre- and post-production services within the  
firm (see Chapter 2). 

For example, the SIC metrics fail to capture some 
activities which are carried out in businesses 
classified to service sectors which could be  
classified as manufacturing. A recent study of the  
US manufacturing sector found that a large number 
of firms classified to the wholesale sector also 
designed and coordinated the production of the 
goods they were wholesaling. Classifying these 
factoryless goods producers to manufacturing 
would have shifted 14% of jobs and 16% of output 
from wholesaling to manufacturing4. Another 
example is provided by Berger in a recent study  
of manufacturing in the US5.

“Repairs are another service that manufacturing 
firms have offered. We do not have measures 
across the economy of how significant a fraction 
of manufacturing company revenues derive from 
repair services, but the interviews suggest it may be 
substantial. The CEO of a New England company 
that makes tanks and piping for biotech firms 
estimated that about a quarter of his revenues 
derive from repairs on equipment – from all makers, 
not only their own – and fully one half of his profits.” 

In addition, there is evidence6 that in 2009 UK firms 
that engaged in both manufacturing and other 
non-manufacturing activities accounted for around 
23% of all market-sector output, whereas their 
manufacturing activities alone accounted for slightly 
less than 8% of total UK output7.

Another deficiency with existing metrics used in the 
UK is their failure to quantify the value of goods and 
services systematically along the value-chain. 

The ONS collects some limited data on the type  
of goods and services bought-in by firms, and to 
which broad sectors goods and services are sold 
(input-output linkages of firms and products). This 
allows them to construct Supply-and-Use and Input-
Output tables for the UK8 which show in aggregate 
the flow of goods and services along the supply 
chain. However, it is not possible to use these data to 
measure which ‘core’ fabricated products also involve 
‘manufacturing-dependent’ pre- and post-production 
goods and services. To do this would require access 
to individual firm data supplied to the ONS, with 
information on: 

  What goods and services are bought-in and to 

whom output is sold; and 

  Which plants and firms supply and purchase these 

goods and services, and what proportion of the 
value added of a firm classified to manufacturing 
consists, for example, of value added through 
R&D and post sales services compared to the 
manufacturing process per se.

Careful consideration would need to be given to 
the level of the business unit at which the data are 
collected, and its potential sensitivity. A new pilot 
project could be undertaken by the ONS. This 
would allow the importance of manufacturing in the 
economy to be assessed more accurately, and the 
potential cost in terms of business reporting and 
survey administrative costs to be evaluated. It would 
also provide important insights into the nature of the 
value-added chain in the pilot sample. This would be 
a key factor in understanding the determinants of 
competitiveness identified in Chapter 4 (covering not 
only control of value chains, but other issues such as 
co-location, and the importance of the service content 
of the products of manufacturing firms (servitisation)). 

It is important to note that the rationale for 
developing new metrics is not to ‘increase’ the size 
of the manufacturing sector, but to provide a means 
of assessing the significance of service content in the 
success of manufacturing business models and the 
interrelationship between manufacturing and  
other sectors.

manufacturing) are operating their different firms and plants as part of a vertically integrated supply-chain. It is likely that most are operating plants that 
are ‘trading’ with each other. However, other enterprises could be operating firms and plants in distinct industries (i.e., as a conglomerate). Conversely, 
firms and plants operating along the value-added chain do not need to belong to a common enterprise, so the estimate of 23% may be a major 
underestimate. 8 ONS (2011)

7.2 tarGetinG  
SPecific StaGeS  
of the  
manufacturinG 
value chain

Manufacturing has changed dramatically since  
the heyday of industrial policies in the 1970s.  
In particular, there is now greater competition to 
control, operate and integrate manufacturing value 
chains, greater mobility of investment capital, lower 
trade costs, and heightened tax competition9.  
An industrial strategy for the next three decades 
must take account of these changes.

First, in a more globalised world, the weight of 
government support needs to shift towards ‘high 
spillover, low mobility’ factors where the UK can 
be more certain of capturing and retaining value, 
for example, enhancing human capital rather than 
transferable technology. The widening of the range 
of feasible destinations across the world for FDI  
in a context of tax competition means that 
government will have to pay greater attention 
to ensuring that the UK can continue to be an 
attractive location. Policies to nurture successful 
agglomerations deserve a high priority and go 
beyond clustering based on the promotion of 
high tech sectors per se. This agglomeration policy 
may have implications for the design of corporate 
taxation but also for a wider range of factors that 
influence mobile capital including infrastructure, the 
science base, availability of skills, and the regulatory 
environment. Most important of all is to recognise 
the value of increasing the geographical ‘stickiness’ 
of economic activity by making alternative locations 
less good substitutes10. 

Secondly, a sharper targeting of specific parts 
of the manufacturing value chain is needed. The 
changes to manufacturing, including fragmentation 
linked to globalisation, the emergence of new 
business models, and the global environment in 
which manufacturing operates have profound 
implications for policy11. At a fundamental level, there 
is a clear case to build upon existing support for 

manufacturing subsectors and partnerships between 
Government and industry, and to ensure that policy 
interventions, where needed, are more targeted 
at different technologies, sectors and stages in the 
manufacturing value chain. 

Future industrial policies, informed by updated 
metrics (see Section 7.1), will need to be used 
to develop new measures tailored to specific 
requirements of manufacturing sub-sectors and the 
technologies upon which successful future business 
models will be built. This will include, for example: 

 

 

 

Facilitating the emergence of challenger 
businesses. These exploit new business models 
and cross cutting approaches in technologies, 
across sub-sectors, to drive ‘disruptive growth’ 
in manufacturing. For example, support might 
focus on businesses specialising in advanced 
materials, big data or related applications, 
or additive manufacturing technology, all of 
which collaborate with others to work across 
manufacturing sub-sectors; 
Enhancing UK capabilities that cannot easily 
be relocated abroad. This is particularly 
important given the increasing ease with which 
manufacturing activities and the different elements 
of value chains can now be relocated around 
the world. This will include the promotion of the 
‘co-location’ of R&D with production and the 
science base, particularly for products dependent 
on process innovation. A new emphasis on vibrant 
labour markets, digital and transport infrastructure 
will be key. 
Supporting the creation of new revenue streams 
from manufacturing services, for example 
capitalising upon knowledge generated by 
sensors embedded in products; and

  Helping manufacturers to expand their capabilities 

in re-manufacturing and resource efficiency.

Meeting these requirements will require a shift by 
Government towards a systems based rationale for 
the design and delivery of industrial policy.

movinG towardS a ‘SyStemS BaSed 
aPProach’ to induStrial Policy

Learning from the past12

A wide variety of definitions of industrial policy 
exist. A helpful and broad recent definition is the 
following: ‘Industrial policy is any type of intervention 
or Government policy that attempts to improve 
the business environment or to alter the structure 
of economic activity towards sectors, technologies 
or tasks that are expected to offer better prospects 
for economic growth or societal welfare than would 
occur in the absence of any such intervention ...’ 
(Warwick, K. 201313).

The market failure rationale for industrial policy 
is based on the view that because some kinds 
of investments yield gains which go beyond the 
individual firm making the investment, there will be 
a systematic tendency for under-investment by the 
private sector. To the extent that these investments 
are important for the overall economic growth of 
the country and for the future growth of societal 
welfare, governments may need to intervene so 
that the level of investment is raised. Examples of 
such interventions by Governments to offset the 
problems of market failure include investments in 
human capital through education and training, and in 
R&D. In both cases the private return is likely to be 
lower than the social rate of return as ‘knowledge’ 
generated from undertaking R&D often ‘spills-over’ 
to those not directly involved in making the initial 
investment. Workers who have been trained by one 
firm may leave to transfer their skills to another 
which did not pay for the training. 

Traditionally, this market failure rationale for 
intervention has resulted in industrial policy that can 
broadly be distinguished in terms of ‘horizontal’ and 
‘selective’ industrial policies (see Table 7.1). The latter 
are aimed specifically at improving the performance 
of particular industries or firms while the former are 
designed to benefit the economy more generally.

The future of manufacturing: A new era of opportunity and challenge for the UK208

Although there are many examples of successful 
industrial policies in developed economies14, 
‘industrial policy’ has long had a bad press in the 
UK15. There is a good reason for this, namely, the 
policy failures of the 1960s and, especially, the 
1970s16. Although the widely recognised failures  
of that period relate to selective policies, there 
were also flaws in the design of horizontal policies. 
Both types of policy turned out often to be poor 
value for money either by giving support to firms or 
projects with no viable long-term future or through 
incurring large ‘deadweight losses’ by subsidising 
activities such as investment expenditure where 
most expenditure would have happened anyway.

The downside of industrial policies is that they  
may be vulnerable to ‘government failure’  
where the choice or implementation of policy is 
inefficient. The reasons for this can sometimes be 
inexperience or lack of information but there are 
also reasons to worry about systemic problems 
arising from the political process which may be 
prone to short-termism and unduly influenced 
by lobbying. Although these issues largely relate 
to selective policies, the problem goes wider, as is 
illustrated by the history of British investment in 
public infrastructure17.

The most obvious improvement in horizontal 
policies from the 1970s in relation to manufacturing 
was to increase competition across much of 
the economy through the abandonment of 
protectionism, entry into the Single European 
Market, deregulation and, ultimately, a strengthening 
of competition policy. Indeed, the overall trajectory 
of UK industrial policy since the late 1970s is 
perhaps best described as seeking to improve the 
workings of a ‘liberal market economy’ by addressing 
‘market failures’. 

Current thinking about policy development 
however, goes beyond traditional arguments about 
market-failure to embrace notions of ‘systems 
failure’, especially in innovation and technical change. 
A systems approach (see Box 7.3) focuses on 
coordination problems and is especially useful  
in the context of promoting the development, 
awareness and exploitation of new technological 
opportunities. Traditional approaches to selective 
industrial policy identified sectors or firms to 
support but a systems approach is based on 
selecting new ideas as they emerge from the science 
base and working back from sectoral problem-
solving and technical challenges. Whereas the old 
vocabulary was about ‘picking winners’, the new 
terminology is that of ‘choosing races and placing

Box 7.3: three core elementS of  
a SyStemS aPProach19
1.  The economic ‘actors’ operating within the 

particular regional national or sector system.  
This includes private sector consumers and 
businesses, and the public and not-for-profit 
sectors. Firms in the system identify commercially 
attractive opportunities and devise business 
models to exploit them. In doing this they must 
invest in human and financial capital and a wide 
range of intangible assets including R&D, design 
and ICT. A firm’s investment in R&D generates 
new knowledge and increases capacity to absorb 
ideas from external sources20. 

2.  The second element is usually defined as 

‘institutions’. These are not to be understood 
as organisations or entities, but rather as the 
‘norms of conduct’ or ‘rules of the game’, including 
contractual legal and regulatory systems within 
which economic actors operate. 

3.  The third element consists of the ‘connections’ 
between economic actors. System connections 
encompass a wide variety of non-market as well 

as market relationships including collaborative 
and formal, and informal, interpersonal and inter-
organisational networking connections. There may 
be significant variations across sectors, regions, 
technological trajectories and national systems in  
the strength, nature and variety of connections and 
their interplay with institutional differences21. 

The institutions and connections define the 
‘institutional architecture’ within which the economic 
actors operate. This institutional architecture will 
affect both the nature of systems failures and the 
feasibility and effectiveness of ‘traditional‘ policy 
measures applied in different systems22. If for example 
the incentives for manufacturing firms to invest for 
the long term are not matched by incentives in the 
financial sector to support such investment, there will 
be a systems failure and the institutional architecture 
will lead to underinvestment in the long-term. In the 
case of the UK variety of capitalism (Box 7.4) there is 
substantial evidence that capital market connections to 
manufacturing investment are inhibited via an emphasis 
on short-termism in the financial sector23. A systems 
perspective on policy therefore must address a wider 
range of issues than market failure. 

 

Institutional architecture may also alter the nature 
of innovation by inhibiting incremental innovation. 
Impatient capital markets may be complementary 
to labour markets focused on ‘hire and fire’ 
relationships which inhibit more stable labour 
contracts that foster investment in firm specific 
training and skills27.

Box 7.4: inStitutional architecture 
and varietieS of caPitaliSm
 

Institutional architecture is related to the concept 
of ‘varieties of capitalism’ which has been used to 
suggest that the nature of investment will differ 
significantly between countries24. 
For investment generally, and R&D in particular, 
it has been argued that the UK variety of liberal 
market capitalism inhibits long-term investment 
compared with more coordinated varieties 
exemplified by Germany and Japan25. 
Impatient capital markets driven by an over-
concern with short-term movements in stock 
market prices, the threat of takeover, and arms-
length relationships between the providers 
and users of finance, serve to promote short-
termism in investment decisions26.

The future of manufacturing: A new era of opportunity and challenge for the UK210

Market failure and systems failure

Systems failure and the diffusion of innovations

The mainstream arguments on market failure set out 
earlier provide important rationales for public sector 
intervention, but rarely provide sufficient guidance 
for the degree of intervention in particular instances 
or different systems. Nor do they address the many 
other potential institutional and connection failures 
which may arise when a systems-based approach  
is adopted28. 

System failures can arise from various sources. 
Transition and lock-in problems, for example, arise 
from inertia due to substantial sunk investment by 
private and public sectors in existing or dominant 
technologies. These are linked to transition failures 
in moving to new technological structures which 
pose major problems of investment and business 
reorganisation, for example, in the switch to low 
carbon vehicles29. Institutional system failures arise 
when formal and informal rules and incentives 
affecting different parts of the system are 
inconsistent. An example is the alleged difference in 
norms and incentives between academic scientists 
and the private sector in conducting research. Here it 
is argued that the former emphasise open publication 
and disclosure, whilst the private sector, in its pursuit 
of research connected to private exploitation, is 
committed to secrecy and patent protection30. 

Systems failure and demand side policy 

One of the most important implications arising from 
the development of more systemic views has been 
the emphasis given to the development of demand 
side as well as supply side policies in addressing lock 
in, and transition problems and uncertainties. This 
is based around the potential role in demand side 
policies of the public sector as a procurer of R&D 
and the role of public procurement more generally 
in influencing the scale, direction and form of the 
provision of the goods and services it purchases31. 
Public procurement is then seen as a potentially 
important demand side innovation policy device 
for reducing uncertainty in areas where lead user 
activities are important. Public procurement can also 
be seen as complementary to supply side measures 
linked to standard market failure arguments which, 
through taxation and subsidy, influence the relative 
prices at which businesses conduct their innovation 
related activities32.

An important aspect of productivity growth is the 
effective assimilation of new technology across 
economic actors in the system. Diffusion of new 
technologies may be inhibited where system lock-
ins occur due to the strength of major past or ‘sunk’ 
investments supporting existing technologies (for 
example electric versus petrol-driven automobiles). 
Here sector-based selective industrial policies may 
include the use of demonstrator or pilot plants and 
public procurement. Policy can support diffusion 
through provision of information and the improvement 
of market and non-market connections between firms, 
and between them and the science base by enhancing 
the profitability of adopting innovations and by raising 
the absorptive capacity of firms33. Absorptive capacity 
entails the ability of firms to search for, evaluate, 
assimilate, and exploit knowledge. This is underpinned 
by education and skills but also by investments in 
intangible capital including crucially R&D34 but also 
training, flexibility in use of business models, effective 
cooperation with research organisations, and 
organisational capabilities so that each of these become 
part of the industrial policy domain35. 

Systems thinking and current UK policy

Systems thinking has already had an impact on UK 
industrial policy36 development. A range of innovation 
policies inspired by systems thinking were reinforced  
or introduced from the 1990s onwards as a result of  
a series of innovation policy reviews37. 

A number of the most recent developments in 
policy have been designed to establish a richer 
institutional architecture linking universities and the 
business community, and the development of sectoral 
and technological strategies. This has included the 
development of a set of ‘Catapult’ centres, discussed 
in Chapter 3, focused around a selected set of themes 
and technologies38. In general, evaluations of systems 
based interventions related to innovation have been 
more favourable than the market failure based 
industrial policies introduced in the 1970s39.

A ‘systems-based approach’ for the future

In thinking about the next 30 years, the question is 
whether the UK will be better served by a continued 
mix of ‘horizontal’ and ‘selective’ industrial policies, 
or by an attempt to build on recent system-based 
policies. This systems approach would address aspects 

7. Systemic areas for Government focus: Priorities and next steps211

of the institutional architecture which are recognised 
as inhibiting the future development of manufacturing 
within the economy. This report emphasises that this 
approach is the way forward, with three key challenges 
to meet in doing so: 

  The need to integrate science technology and 

innovation policy with industrial policy. This will allow 
for enhanced coordination of policy and make it 
easier to identify potential unintended consequences 
of policies and to identify where policy intervention 
would achieve the greatest impact. 

  The need to develop innovative ways of informing 
strategic choices when ‘choosing races and placing 
bets’. This involves governments developing new 
metrics to capture the changing nature and role of 
manufacturing. Crucially it will also involve working 
with the private sector to develop a deep shared 
understanding of different sectoral or technological 
systems, their associated manufacturing value 
chains and the possibilities for capturing value 
added in the UK.

Figure 7.1: A typology of policy domains 

SCIENCE POLICY
Focus: Production of scientific knowledge
Instruments:
• Public research funds granted in competition
• (Semi-) Public research institutions (i.e.: laboratories, universities, 
  research centres)
• Tax incentives to firms
• Higher education
• Intellectual property rights

TECHNOLOGY POLICY
Focus: Advancement and commercialisation of sectoral technical
knowledge
Instruments:
• Public procurement
• Public aid to strategic sectors 
• Bridging institutions (between research world & industry)
• Labour force training & improvement of technical skills
• Standardisation
• Technology forecasting
• Benchmarking industrial sectors

Source: Lundvall and Borrás (2005)

  The need to assess whether there are changes in 

policy architecture to support this approach. South 
Korea, for example, launched the Ministry of Science, 
ICT and Future Planning40 in 2013 to integrate 
science and technology in general, and ICT, and to 
establish, coordinate, and evaluate policies related to 
science and technology41.

Integrating science, technology, innovation and 
industrial policy 

Science policy, technology policy and innovation policy 
are often treated separately from industrial policy  
(see Figure 7.1). There is a strong overlap between the 
instruments of intervention, in particular as the focus 
moves from technology policy towards innovation 
policy and they must be developed and applied in  
an integrated fashion.

Strategic choices

An example of a strategic systems approach to 
technology selection along the lines advocated is shown 
in Box 7.542. 

INNOVATION POLICY
Focus: Overall innovative performance of the economy
Instruments:
• Improving individual skills & learning abilities (through general 
  education system & labour training
• Improving organisational performance & learning (i.e. ISO 9000 
  standards, quality control, etc.)
• Improving access to information: 
  Information society
• Environmental regulation
• Bioethical regulation
• Competition regulations
• Consumer protection
• Corporate law
• Improving social capital for regional development: Clusters &
  industrial districts
• Intellectual bench marking
• Intelligent, reflexive & democratic forecasting

28 See for example Metcalfe, J. (2005); Dodgson, M. et al. (2011); BIS (2011) and for a comparison of systems and market failures Chaminade and Edquist (2010).  
29 HM Government (2008); King, J. (2008). 30 This has engendered a major debate in the UK over the extent to which the allocation of public funds should be 
directed according to the motivations and the incentives of the former as compared to the latter, the nature of UK university-industry links, and the design of 
intermediary organisations on the boundaries of universities and industry (The Royal Society (2011); Hughes, A. (2012); Hauser, H. (2010); Mina, A. et al. (2009); 
Deiaco, E. et al. (2012); Hughes, A. and Kitson, M. (2012). 31 Edquist, C. et al. (2000); OECD (2010a); Connell, D. and Probert, J. (2010). 32 OECD (2010b).

for Trade and Industry (2003a); Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (2008); BIS (2011). 38 This followed a review of practices in other countries and under 
the auspices of the Technology Strategy Board has led to the creation of seven catapult centres once again selectively focused on a range of sectoral or technological 
domains. See Hauser, H. (2010) and TSB, (2011). 39 Evidence Paper 37: Crafts, N. & Hughes, A. (2013). 40 For further details see: http://www.msip.go.kr/index.do

7. Systemic areas for Government focus: Priorities and next steps

  An examination of the risks arising from the risk 

of failure in the design or implementation of public 
support policy failure and/or the failure of the 
developing technology itself. 

  The final stage is to identify the form of government 

intervention which would be most appropriate, 
including the potential for the government to play 
a lead role as a procurer of R&D services, or ability 
of the public sector to promote (or not inhibit) 
appropriate co-location and agglomeration effects. 
It may include the development of appropriate 
intermediating organisations, e.g. catapult centres, 
which in particular science and technology 
areas may span both national and international 
university/industry boundaries and enhance the 
commercialisation process43. 

This process involves the development of an 
appropriate capacity in the public sector itself to 
generate, in combination with business, the kind of 
data required to drive such a process. It also requires 
persistence and incremental learning in the process of 
policy delivery and smart public procurement. Failure 
will be a feature of the system of support and a few 
successful outcomes will dominate overall gains, so 
political leadership will be essential.

Box 7.5: a SyStemS BaSed aPProach  
to Policy develoPment
A 2007 UK Prime Minister’s Council for Science 
and Technology (CST) report proposed a staged 
approach to technology selection and the design 
of policy support which is consistent with the 
approach advocated above. Key stages include:

  An assessment of where the UK possesses 

distinctive and outstanding scientific and 
technological competence in particular areas. 

  An analysis of the potential market size of 

successful innovations in the relevant  
technology space. 

  An assessment of the UK’s capacity to deliver in 
terms of private and public sector investment in 
the innovation and commercialisation process. 
This includes a value chain analysis in areas of 
potential applications and an assessment of the 
extent to which it will be possible to appropriate 
a significantly large element of it. It is at this 
stage that internationalisation of the applications 
and value chains and their future potential 
trajectories must be identified and understood. 

Three elements, in particular, are critical to the 
design of effective policy for the longer term, and 
are consistent with Box 7.544:

 

First, policy development needs to be 
embedded in private sector networks so it can 
draw upon and connect with and between 
information sources in that sector. A wide 
range of institutions may serve this purpose, 
from informal and formal development forums 
through to advisory councils and intermediating 
Research and Technology Organisations. 

  The second feature is the necessity of combining 

incentives with disincentives and exercising 
options to enhance lines of support or to enable 
the weeding out of investments that fail or 
activities that become ‘honourable dead-ends’45. 

  Third, policy must be viewed as a learning 

process. Policy-makers must accept a failure rate 
consistent with the underlying riskiness of the 
activity and the development of policy must be 
based on systematic and regular evaluation.

caPaBility in

Policy over the 
lonG term

It is essential that policy architecture evolves so that 
governments can deliver the integrated systems 
approach advocated. A particular issue here is 
developing policy with a longer term perspective 
independent of the instabilities produced by the 
electoral cycle. 

Examples of where this has been achieved in other 
areas of policy include: an independent Bank of 
England to implement monetary policy; the National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to 
advise the NHS on the take-up of new treatments; 
and the removal of ministerial discretion on cases 
investigated by the Competition Commission. This 
has not generally been the case with regard to 
industrial strategy. 

In considering future industrial strategy focused 
on the manufacturing sector and any related 
institutional reforms, it is recommended that close 
attention be paid to institutional developments in 
other countries. Three relevant examples are the US 
Advance Manufacturing National Programme Office 
(AMNPO), the Australian Productivity Commission 
(APC), and the UK Independent Commission for 
Aid Impact (ICAI) (see Box 7.6).

It is also recommended that a better sharing of 
future understanding and intelligence between 
the Department for Business Innovation and Skills 
and the Technology Strategy Board is pursued, in 
effect a shift in balance from sponsorship towards 
knowledge transfer.

Box 7.6: examPleS of inStitutional

and the uk 
Advanced Manufacturing National Programme Office 
(AMNPO), United States: Charged with implementing 
a whole-of-government advanced manufacturing 
initiative to facilitate collaboration across federal 
agencies and convening private-public partnerships 
focused on manufacturing innovation. It is hosted by 
the National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST), and is staffed by representatives from federal 
agencies with manufacturing-related missions and 
fellows from manufacturing businesses and universities. 
By coordinating resources and programmes, AMNPO 
will enhance technology transfer and help businesses 
overcome obstacles to scaling up production of new 
technologies. It was recommended by the Advanced 
Manufacturing Partnership Steering Committee and 
endorsed by the President’s Council of Advisers on 
Science and Technology46. 

The Australian Productivity Commission (APC), 
Australia: The APC is the Australian Government’s 
independent research and advisory body on a range 
of economic, social and environmental issues affecting 
the welfare of Australians. It is an advisory body and 
does not administer government programmes or 
exercise executive power. Its contribution hinges on 
the value of the independent advice and information it 
provides. Its operating principles include Independence 
(the Commission operates under the powers of its 
own legislation, with its own budgetary allocation and 
permanent staff, and reports formally through the 
Treasurer to the Australian Parliament); transparency; 
and taking a community-wide perspective47.

The Independent Commission for Aid Impact (ICAI), 
UK: ICAI is the independent body responsible for 
the scrutiny of UK aid. It focuses on maximising the 
impact and effectiveness of the UK aid budget for 
intended beneficiaries and the delivery of value 
for money for the UK taxpayer. Led by a Chief 
Commissioner, ICAI reports to Parliament through 
the House of Commons International Development 
Committee. It publishes transparent, impartial and 
objective reports on the effectiveness of UK aid, and 
ensures that its recommendations lead to change by 
providing evidence-based feedback into Government 
decision making. ICAI recommendations play a role in 
supporting the UK to spend aid on what works best.

214

Building on insights from the above examples, 
it is recommended that to strengthen future 
governments’ capability in evaluating and 
coordinating policy over the long term, the 
UK Government should create an ‘Office for 
Manufacturing’. This would:

  Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of industrial 

 

 

policies relevant to manufacturing, embracing  
a role similar to that of the Australian APC;
Identify relevant international best practice and 
highlight this to government; 
Ensure the collation and effective use of new 
best practice metrics for manufacturing (see 
Section 7.1), also drawing in intelligence on 
manufacturing value chains from the wider public 
sector including Research Councils and the 
Technology Strategy Board; and

  Advise on where cross Government 

coordination can be strengthened and simplified.

 

7.4 areaS for  
further  
inveStiGation

A number of specific areas of future importance to 
the manufacturing sector identified in this Report 
are also relevant to the wider economy, and merit 
further investigation. Policy makers are likely to 
benefit from examining three areas, outlined below 
which would help to inform actions being taken to 
support long term UK economic growth. Evidence 
commissioned by the Project could be used as a 
starting point.

Policy deSiGn: adaPtinG and learninG 
from inStitutional arranGementS in 
Place in other countrieS
There are several references in this Report to 
the roles of institutional architecture in support 
of manufacturing. Across the world, a variety of 
elements contribute to the institutional systems put 
in place to support firms, not only in manufacturing 
but in all forms of industrial activity. Simply seeking 
to transpose any particular institution to the UK 
would be misguided. Instead it is suggested that a 

48 Evidence Paper 16: Hughes, A. (2013); and Kay, J. (2012). 

detailed study is commissioned to identify the role 
and effect of each element in these architectures 
and systems, identify gaps in the UK system and 
evaluate the institutional changes which may be 
needed in the UK to enhance its capacity to build 
on ‘best and most effective practice’ lessons from 
other countries. There is specific merit in applying 
the findings to the operation of capital and labour 
markets in manufacturing.

the need for increaSinG the 
availaBility and quality of lonG term 
(or Patient) caPital to SuPPort lonG 
term SuStainaBle value creation
A consequence of the manner of development 
of the UK’s financial services industry over the 
past 40 years is that providers of finance have 
developed a behaviour whereby they generally 
have a greater alignment of interests with their 
own sources of funds than with the firm to whom 
they are providing the finance. This is inevitable, 
as providers of funds to banks and other financial 
institutions do so on a regular basis. They are repeat 
clients of the bank whereas the firm is an infrequent 
one. A similar phenomenon can occur with the 
equity markets where fund managers are quite 
correctly preoccupied with competing to meet the 
expectations of those who have placed savings with 
them rather than with the interests of the  
firm whose shares they might hold.

The consequent short termism or lack of patient 
capital which is linked to this is particularly important 
to manufacturing48. A greater understanding of the 
impact of capital market behaviour on strategic 
decision taking and investment decisions by business 
leaders at all levels of economic activity would 
help inform public and private sector dialogue on 
the development of industrial strategy and other 
agendas. Further investigation should examine:

  The drivers and support for short-termism 

including disincentives to accumulate  
capital stock. 

  The impact on exit rather than sustaining 

strategies by company leaders, as a result of 
share based executive reward plans, terms of 
reference of the take-over panel, tax treatment 
of interest, and short term performance 
requirements by fund managers.

7. Systemic areas for Government focus: Priorities and next steps215

  The consequences of short term timescales 
for meeting pension funding requirements on 
firms’ availability of funds for investment and on 
strategic choices.

  The scope for delivering wider and deeper 
access to finance for SMEs through lower 
cost credit and greater administrative capacity 
for loan arrangements in banks to enhance 
the relationships between banks and firms, 
particularly manufacturers.

Socio-economic challenGeS 
This Project has examined the performance of the 
UK manufacturing sector compared to competitor 
countries, highlighting various features associated with 
success and failure. One of these features encompasses 
the national belief in, and support for, value creation 
and perceptions of its role in high value job creation 
and addressing socio-economic challenges. 

While difficult to measure objectively, in some of the 
more successful economies, such as the US, Germany, 
the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden, Japan, Singapore 
and Korea, it appears that a value creation ‘mind-set’ 
is embedded in the national psyche. This is potentially 
reflected in the level of interest in examining future 
trends affecting manufacturing49. In the UK, this mind-
set is less apparent and there is limited consensus 
about the importance of investing for the long-term, 
or that manufacturing matters in either a value 
creation or wider socio-economic setting. Indeed, 
research suggests that amongst a sizeable share of 
the population, including amongst younger people, 
manufacturing is held in relatively low esteem50.

Looking to the future, there is a case for examining 
how the UK could strengthen its approach 
to nurturing and celebrating high quality job 
opportunities and value creation in manufacturing 
and the contributions to be made by innovation in 
manufacturing in addressing future environmental 
challenges in energy and sustainability. A study on 
this topic could build on evidence commissioned by 
this Project by considering:

  How governments communicate the role of 

industry and value creation across society
  How business behaviours in the countries 
identified above differ from those in the UK

  How attitudes in the countries identified above 
have developed, including high impact initiatives

  How value creation is recognised and/or 

celebrated by society

  How the link between value creation, high skilled 

job opportunities and wider socio-economic 
objectives is understood

7.5 next StePS – 
who needS  
to do what 

This chapter has set out a framework for 
Government action, in partnership with industry, 
which focuses on: 

 
 
 

four future characteristics of manufacturing; 
three systemic areas for Government focus; and
three areas which require further investigation. 

Taken together, the suggested changes amount to a 
fundamental shift in the focus, balance and operation 
of Government support, to help ensure that the 
manufacturing sector is able to thrive in the future.

This framework will need to be considered in the 
round, but immediate steps should be taken to 
prioritise and implement a number of the suggested 
measures, which should build upon existing initiatives 
where relevant. The detailed evidence papers are an 
important resource in explaining the rationale for 
the actions, and in providing more detail. 

The framework for action needs to be followed up 
quickly. Failure to do so will hinder the efficiency 
and effectiveness of the detailed actions. This will 
further increase the potential for the UK to miss 
important new opportunities for value creation 
from manufacturing.

The future of manufacturing: A new era of opportunity and challenge for the UK242

Glossary and acronyms

ANNEX c: GLoSSAry ANd AcroNyMS

Absorptive capacity: A firm’s ability to recognize the value of new information, assimilate it, and apply it to 
commercial ends.

Additionality: Net positive difference that results from intervention.

Additive manufacturing/3d Printing: A process of making a three-dimensional solid object of virtually 
any shape from a digital model. It is considered distinct from traditional machining techniques, which mostly rely 
on the removal of material by methods such as cutting or drilling (subtractive processes).

Balance of Payments: A record of financial transactions made between consumers, businesses and the 
government in one country with others. The BOP figures tell us about how much is being spent by consumers 
and firms on imported goods and services, and how successful firms have been in exporting to other countries. 

Base projection: A projection showing the development that would occur if current trends are maintained.

Big data/ubiquitous data: Datasets whose size is beyond the ability of typical database software tools to 
capture, store, manage and analyse.

Business model: The rationale of how an organization creates, delivers, and captures value (economic, social, 
cultural, or other forms of value).

circular economy: A circular economy is an alternative to a traditional linear economy (make, use, dispose) 
in which we keep resources in use for as long as possible, extract the maximum value from them whilst in use, 
then recover and regenerate products and materials at the end of each service life.

collaborative consumption: A class of economic arrangements in which participants share access to 
products or services, rather than having individual ownership.

cloud computing: A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared 
pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can 
be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

deindustrialisation/reindustrialisation: Is a process of social and economic change caused by 
the removal or reduction of industrial capacity or activity in a country or region, especially heavy industry 
or manufacturing industry. Reindustrialisation therefore is an increase in industrial capacity following 
deindustrialisation.

driver of change: A factor which causes a particular phenomenon to happen or develop.

Firm margin: Number of firms and export intensity.

Firm-product margin: Number of products each firm sells and average export value.

Firm-product-destination margin: Number of destinations in which a firm sells and average export value.

243

Foreign direct Investment (FdI): FDI is defined as cross-border investment by a resident entity in one 
economy with the objective of obtaining a lasting interest in an enterprise resident in another economy. 

General Purpose technology (GPt): 
A term coined to describe a new method of producing and inventing that is important enough to have a 
protracted aggregate impact. Electricity and information technology (IT) probably are the two most important 
GPTs so far.

Greenfield investment: A term often used in the context of FDI, it is the expansion of existing facilities  
or a direct investment in new facilities (in an area where no previous facilities exist). The name comes from  
the idea of building a facility verbatim on a “green” field, such as farmland or a forest. Over time the term  
has become more metaphoric.

Gross domestic Product (GdP): A measure of the value of the goods and services produced in the 
economy in the year. It is a good indicator of the wealth and economic development of a country. 

Gross value Added (GvA): A measure of the value of the goods and services produced in the economy 
and is used to monitor the performance of the national economy as a whole. GVA is calculated as: the value  
of sales of goods and services minus the cost of purchases of energy goods, materials and services.

Horizontal collaboration: The pooling of resources and capabilities by competing organizations across  
the supply chain.

Industrial commons: The embedded knowledge and technology framework that enhances the efficiency, 
effectiveness, and productivity of the proprietary capital and labour that use it.

Industrial ecology: Involves the study of the “flows” of materials and energy through socio-economic 
systems with a view to optimizing their use. 

Industrial symbiosis: An association between two or more industrial facilities or companies in which  
the wastes or byproducts of one become the raw materials for another.

Internet of things: Is widely presented as the next revolution towards massively distributed information, 
where any real world object can participate in the internet and thus be globally discovered and queried.

International Standard Industrial classification (ISIc): ISIC is a system created by the United 
Nations for classifying business establishments and other statistical units by the type of economic activity  
in which they are engaged.

Manufacturing value Added (MvA): Manufacturing refers to industries belonging to SIC divisions  
15-37. Value added is the net output of a sector after adding up all outputs and subtracting intermediate inputs. 
It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or depletion and degradation  
of natural resources. 

offshoring: The move of a company’s processes or services overseas.

onshoring/reshoring: 
Onshoring, sometimes known as reshoring is a term used to describe the relocation of firms operations back 
to the country from which they originated. 

The future of manufacturing: A new era of opportunity and challenge for the UK244

Glossary and acronyms

Purchasing Power Parity (PPP): 
An economic theory and a technique used to determine the relative value of currencies, estimating the amount 
of adjustment needed on the exchange rate between countries in order for the exchange to be equivalent to 
(or on par with) each currency’s purchasing power.

resilience: 
The term describes the ability of companies or individuals to come to terms with changing circumstances  
and adjust their business or personal strategies and models accordingly.

Servitization: 
Products today have a higher service component than in previous decades. In the management literature this  
is referred to as the servitization of products. Virtually every product today has a service component to it.

Spillover: 
Spillover effects are externalities of economic activity or processes (such as knowledge or technology)  
that affect those who are not directly involved.

Sustainability: 
The creation and maintenance of the conditions under which humans and nature can exist in productive 
harmony, that permit fulfilling the social, economic and other requirements of present and future generations.

Sustainable development: Development that meets the needs of the present, without compromising  
the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

Sustainable technologies: Technologies that reduce material or energy use to levels considered 
sustainable in the long term. This covers a very broad range of technologies from the more obvious clean 
energy technologies such as wind and solar, to everyday products with better environmental performance  
such as paint booths that use less water for cleaning.

Systems view: The view that the component parts of a system can best be understood in the context  
of relationships with each other and with other systems, rather than in isolation. Systems thinking focuses  
on cyclical rather than linear cause and effect. 

total Factor Productivity (tFP): Total Factor Productivity (TFP) is the portion of output not explained  
by the amount of inputs used in production. As such, its level is determined by how efficiently and intensely  
the inputs are utilized in production, and by technological change.

value chain: The value chain describes the full range of activities that firms and workers do to bring a 
product from its conception to its end use and beyond. Value chain activities can produce goods or services, 
and can be contained within a single geographical location or spread over wider areas.

vertical collaboration: Pooling of resources and capabilities by complementary organizations up and  
down the supply chain.
